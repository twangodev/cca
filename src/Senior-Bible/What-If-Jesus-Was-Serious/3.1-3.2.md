#  Pt 3: 1 & 2

## Prompt

1. What does “righteous” anger look like to you? How do we trick ourselves into thinking that our anger is justified when it is not?  
2. Read Matthew 21.12-14. How do we view what Jesus did in the Temple? There is always a lot of discussion about Jesus’s anger in this passage. Was it justified? Why or why not? How does this serve as a litmus test for our own anger?  
3. Is outrage a normal response to what we encounter in our world? How can we use it as a vehicle of change rather than a response to pressure?  

## Response

1. "Righteous anger" to me might be seen as a logical response to injustice or violation of ethical standards. However, individuals can deceive themselves into thinking their anger is justified through personal biases or emotional clouding, even when it might not be.
2. In Matthew 21:12-14, Jesus's actions in the Temple can be viewed as a justified stand against corruption and exploitation in a religious space. This passage can serve as a litmus test for personal anger, prompting reflection on whether one's anger is directed towards correcting injustice or is instead serving personal interests.
3. Outrage is a common response to worldly injustices, and it can be harnessed as a force for positive change if channeled constructively, rather than as a knee-jerk reaction to pressure. This involves maintaining rationality and aligning actions with one’s values and goals.
