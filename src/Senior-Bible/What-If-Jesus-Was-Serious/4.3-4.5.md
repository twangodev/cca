#  Pt 4: 3-5

## Prompt

1. Describe what “God is love” means to you. Be specific.
2. How would you explain the “ethic of love” that Jesus teaches on in Matthew 5.38-48? How do we combat our natural desire to retaliate against someone when we have been wronged?
3. What correlation do you see between prayer and community? How do you love your enemies and how can we do this better?
4. Re-read 1 Peter 3.8-9 and then apply Peter’s thoughts to a real-life situation in which you were wronged. (No names – just overarching situation) How could this situation had been different if we took Peter and Jesus seriously?  

## Response

1. However, to me, "God is love" could mean that the essence of God, or whatever higher power there might be, is fundamentally about love, care, and compassion. It's like saying the core of any spirituality or religion should be about spreading kindness and love, rather than getting tangled up in strict rules or rituals.
2. This part of the Bible, where Jesus talks about loving your enemies and turning the other cheek, is pretty challenging. It's about not responding to hate with hate, or hurt with hurt. In high school, when someone wrongs us, our first instinct might be to get back at them or hold a grudge. Jesus' teaching suggests doing the opposite – showing kindness instead of retaliation. It's tough because it's not how we're wired, but I guess it's about breaking the cycle of negativity.
3. I'm not too big on prayer, but I see how it can bring people together.  As for loving enemies it's about trying to understand where they're coming from or not letting their actions affect our peace. We could do better by maybe not gossiping or spreading negativity about them, even if it's tempting.
4. There was this time when a classmate took credit for a group project I did most of the work on. I was really annoyed. But if I were to apply Peter's ideas - like being compassionate, humble, and not seeking revenge - maybe I would have approached the situation differently. Instead of being upset or trying to call them out, maybe having a calm conversation to clear things up would have been better. It's about not letting anger take over and trying to find a peaceful solution, which honestly sounds really mature and something I'm still working on.
