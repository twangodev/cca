# Pt. 7: 3-5

## Prompt

Read #48 (128-129), #49 (130-131) and #50 (132-133) and answer the following questions.

1. Think of an example where you have acted like the Sanhedrin. How did you justify your sin as a way to appear self-righteous?
2. What does it take for you to ask others for something that you need? What does it take for you to ask God for what you need?
3. How does our view of God shape how we think of Godâ€™s desire to bless us? How do we implement pious habits and attitudes as a way of growth rather than as a tool of self-righteous behavior or manipulation?

## Response

1. Sometimes, when I don't finish my homework because I was too busy with extracurricular activities, I blame it on having too much schoolwork, pretending I'm overwhelmed to avoid getting in trouble.
2. Asking others for help is hard because I don't want to seem like I can't handle my responsibilities, but asking God feels easier since I'm not worried about being judged.
3. My view of God is more like a distant figure because I'm always rushing, but I think if I saw God as more of a supportive presence, I'd be more open to seeing blessings instead of just tasks to complete. Implementing small moments of gratitude or reflection might help me grow without feeling like I'm just trying to look good or earn points.
