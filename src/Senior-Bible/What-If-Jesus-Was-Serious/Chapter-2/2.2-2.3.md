#  Pt 2: 2 & 3

## Prompt

1. Why is celebrity something that so many people see as desirable? How does this form of idolatry hurt our witness in the world and our connection with God?
2. How have you been performative in expressing your faith? In what ways has your environment contributed or encouraged it? Challenged it?
3. In both Colossians and 2 Corinthians, Paul writes about the idea of a new identity that we have in Christ and uses the image of “old things passing away.” Where in your life, might you need to let the old things pass away to really embrace God’s purpose for your life? What might renewal look like for you when you step outside CCA’s walls?

## Response

1. Many are drawn to celebrity as it promises validation, affluence, and influence in society. The media’s portrayal of a glamorous life further fuels this desire. However, when we prioritize fame over spiritual values, it can lead to a superficial faith journey. Idolizing celebrity can overshadow our relationship with God, potentially making our spiritual witness in the world seem insincere or shallow.
2. It's not uncommon for individuals to sometimes express their faith more for social validation than genuine connection with God. Our surrounding environment, influenced by societal and cultural norms, can pressurize individuals into these performative expressions. Yet, the same environment can also foster sincere spiritual growth, presenting both challenges and opportunities in one's faith journey.
3. Paul emphasizes in his letters the transformative power of Christ, urging believers to shed their old selves. This concept suggests that there are habits or attitudes that may hold one back from God's intended purpose. As one steps outside familiar settings like CCA, embracing this renewed identity might mean actively seeking to live in alignment with Christ's teachings, and letting go of past hindrances.
