#  Pt 4: 1 & 2

## Prompt

1. Who in your life (without naming names – think traits or ideas) are the hardest for you to love? Why? How does Galatians 6.1-3 help us meet this challenge?
2. Re-read the quote from Dostoyevsky. How do you think we romanticized this version of humanity while breeding contempt for the reality of humanity?
3. Our lived experience shapes how we read and interpret Scripture. How do we allow it to play a role in our pursuit of truth without making assumptions about God’s Word that do not glorify God and hurt others?  

## Response

1. Our experiences inevitably shape how we read and interpret Scripture, as they influence our understanding and perspectives. To balance this in our pursuit of truth, we should be aware of our biases and open to other interpretations. We need to study Scripture carefully, seeking guidance from others and praying for understanding, to ensure our interpretations glorify God and do not harm others. It's about finding a balance between our personal experiences and the timeless truths in God’s Word.
2. The quote from Dostoyevsky might be seen as idealizing the concept of human nature, focusing on its more noble and beautiful aspects. This romanticized view can make us overlook the real, more flawed side of humanity. It's easy to love an idealized version of people but challenging to accept their real, imperfect selves, which can lead to contempt when they don't live up to our expectations.
