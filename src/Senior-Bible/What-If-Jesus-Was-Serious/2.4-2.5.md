#  Pt 2: 4 & 5

## Prompt

1. Why do you think that Christians have historically split over the issues of evangelism (spreading the message about Jesus Christ – His Life, death, resurrection, and what faith in Christ means for us) and seeking (social) justice?
2. How can “love” be the train engine that leads us both justice and evangelism when love means so many different things to different people?
3. How do the metaphors of salt and light help us rethink our role in society? How do they influence the way we think about how we engage in culture?

## Response

1. Over time, Christians have often viewed evangelism and social justice as competing priorities due to theological differences and interpretations. The urgency of personal salvation for some overshadowed societal transformation. Additionally, as secular definitions of justice emerged, some Christians hesitated to align with broader social justice movements.
2. Though interpretations of love vary, its essence of care and sacrifice is universal. The love displayed by Jesus bridges evangelism and justice, both being expressions of love for God and neighbor. Grounded in Scripture, love serves as the motivating force for both sharing the Gospel and advocating for justice.
3. Salt, a preservative, symbolizes Christians' role in resisting societal decay. Light illuminates truth and dispels ignorance. These metaphors urge Christians to actively engage in society, sharing Christ's message and addressing injustices.
