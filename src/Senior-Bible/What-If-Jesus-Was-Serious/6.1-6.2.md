## Prompt

## Response

1. How much does the approval of others influence the way we perceive ourselves? How does it influence our spiritual lives?

    The approval of others significantly shapes how we perceive ourselves, making us often prioritize their opinions over our own true feelings. It can sideline our spiritual pursuits if they don't align with the expectations or norms within our peer group.

2. What thoughts come to mind when you see a car that is covered in Christian platitude sayings or other political sayings?

    Seeing a car covered in Christian platitudes or political statements makes me think the owner is really passionate about their beliefs, but it also makes me wonder if it's more about showing off than genuine conviction.

3. What are the ways that we prop up ourselves to appear better and hide our flaws?

    We often curate our social media profiles to highlight our successes and hide our struggles, creating an image of ourselves that looks more perfect than reality. This act of self-promotion can make it hard to connect authentically with others.

4. Re-read Ezekiel 33.31-32. How can we use flattery as a way to encourage and thank someone rather than to use them for personal gain?

    Flattery should be used to genuinely uplift and encourage someone, focusing on their strengths and contributions rather than as a tool for personal gain. This approach fosters sincerity and builds stronger, more honest relationships.
