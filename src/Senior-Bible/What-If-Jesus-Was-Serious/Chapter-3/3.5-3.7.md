#  Pt 3: 5-7

## Prompt

1. Where in your life do you need guardrails? Do you view these guardrails as a provision instituted by God to protect you or more as a restraint on your autonomy?
2. Jethani writes that the church has often given two options when it comes to models of sexuality – condemnation and accommodation – but both are harmful and unsatisfactory. In your experience (at CCA or church/religious setting), what model is often prescribed? Why do you think that model is chosen?
3. Jethani shifts the conversation from “lust” to “intent” and says that we have a choice to lust after someone we are attracted to. How does this shift push us toward personal accountability and away from blaming others (and what someone might be wearing or not wearing) or the culture at large?
4. What role does discipline play in your life when it comes to thinking about sin? Re-read Hebrews 12.1-4. How can we both pursue holiness despite our sinful nature?  

## Response


1. In my senior year and as I look toward college, I find that guardrails such as family guidance, personal values, and the ethical teachings from my faith are crucial. They help steer me through tough decisions and provide a safety net for the pressures of these pivotal years. I view these guardrails less as restrictions and more as supports to help me stay true to my path, believing that they are divinely placed to protect and direct me.
2. CCA administrators often opt for condemnation regarding models of sexuality, while my classmates and I lean towards accommodation or just let it exists. This reflects a broader generational shift in perspectives, highlighting the need for a more nuanced conversation that bridges the gap between traditional values and modern definitions of inclusivity.
3. Discussing "intent" rather than "lust" places the onus on personal accountability, prompting us to own our actions and desires. This shift from external blame to self-reflection requires us to consider our underlying motives and the effects of our choices. It's a call to exercise self-control and understand the personal and societal impact of our behaviors.
4. Discipline in many faiths is key to aligning behavior with personal values, particularly in resisting sin. The biblical passage Hebrews 12:1-4 likens spiritual discipline to an athlete's rigorous training, focusing on endurance and perseverance. It encourages believers to emulate Jesus' example, enduring trials to achieve the joy of spiritual triumph, suggesting a disciplined pursuit of holiness despite our inherent flaws.
