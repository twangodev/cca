# Doctrine, Dogma vs. Society Handout

## Objective(s)

- Research Historical & Christian perspectives on selected doctrines, dogmas, etc.

    - You MUST use 8-10 reputable sources (peer-reviewed articles, theological websites like CT, Sojourner's, etc. no Wikipedia/History.com, Encyclopedia Brittanica) 
        - Included in these sources, use & incorporate at least 2-3 additional books about theology/social issues.
