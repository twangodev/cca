# An Economic Way of Thinking

## Factors That Contribute To Wealth
- Natural resources 
- Labor 
- Institutions

### Natural resources
Countries with abundant natural resources, such as oil and gas, may have an advantage in terms of economic growth. However, natural resources are not always a guarantee of wealth, as countries with few natural resources can still be wealthy if they have other advantages, such as a skilled workforce or a good education system.

### Labor
A country's workforce is another important factor in its wealth. A country with a large and productive workforce is more likely to be wealthy than a country with a small and unproductive workforce. Productivity can be improved through education, training, and technology.

### Institutions
The rules and regulations that govern a country's economy can also play a role in its wealth. Good institutions, such as a strong legal system and a fair tax system, can help to promote economic growth.

### Other factors
- Entrepreneurship
- Innovation
- Trade

### Smith's Observations
- Adam Smith argued that people want more than just the basic necessities of life.
- They also want things that make life easier, more convenient, and more entertaining.
- The more of these things people have, the richer they are, at least in economic terms.

## What is Economics All About?
- Economics is about understanding the choices that people and businesses make.
- It is about how these choices affect the distribution of resources and the overall well-being of society.
- Economics is also about understanding the forces that drive economic growth and development.

### Economic Enigmas
- Economists study economic enigmas, or puzzles and riddles that can be explained through economic analysis.
- For example, why does popcorn sold at the movies cost more than at a grocery store?
- Or why are so many products sold for $2.99 and so few for $3.00?

## Economics
- The study of how people use their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wants.
- Resources are anything used to produce an economic good or a service.
- Wants are what people desire, but not all wants can be satisfied.
- Scarcity is the condition in which there are not enough resources to satisfy all wants.

### Microeconomics
The study of economic decision making by individuals, households, and businesses.
Focuses on how these individual units interact with each other and with the market.
Macroeconomics

### Macroeconomics
The study of the workings of an economy as a whole.
Focuses on topics such as economic growth, inflation, and unemployment.

### The Science of Decision-Making
- Economics is also the study of how people make choices.
- When people cannot have everything they want, they must make choices about how to allocate their resources.
- Economists study how people make these choices and how they are affected by the choices of others.

## Seven Economical Principles
### Scarcity Forces Tradeoffs
People have unlimited wants but limited resources, so they must make choices.
### Cost-Benefit Principle
People make choices based on the expected costs and benefits.
### Thinking at the Margin
Most decisions involve choices about a little more or a little less of something.
### Incentives Matter
People respond to incentives in generally predictable ways.
### Trade Makes People Better Off
By focusing on what we do well and then trading with others, we can all get more of what we want.
### Markets Coordinate Trade
Markets are usually the best way to coordinate exchanges between buyers and sellers.
### Future Consequences Count
People take into account the future consequences of their choices.

## The Scientific Method
Economists use the scientific method to study how the economy works.

### Questioning and Hypothesizing
Economists start by asking a question about how the economy works.

### Conducting Studies and Collecting Information
To test their hypothesis, economists conduct studies and collect information.

### Analyzing the Information
Once economists have collected the information, they analyze it to see if it supports their hypothesis.

### Evaluating the Hypothesis
Finally, economists evaluate their hypothesis and decide whether it is supported by the evidence.

## Economic Models
A simplified representation of reality that often allows economists to focus on the effects of one change at a time. Models also help economists structure their thinking.
### Types of Economic Models
Mathematical models, computer models, diagrammatic models, and verbal models
### Limitations
- Models are an approximation of how people, in general, act. As such, models cannot accurately predict all behavior all of the time.
- Economists who construct models must make assumptions. These assumptions can limit the applicability of the model.
