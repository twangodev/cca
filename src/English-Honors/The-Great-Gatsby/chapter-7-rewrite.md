# The Great Gatsby Chapter 7 Rewrite
Perspective of Tom: Writing a letter to Daisy about their relationship

Dear Daisy,

Look, I thought everything between us was all right. But the way you looked at Gatsby at lunch today, what was that? And what Gatsby said at the hotel, that "Your wife doesn't love you. She has never loved you. She loves me." That was unacceptable! You made me look like a fool in front of everyone, and I am not that stupid Daisy. How could you dare to have an affair with Gatsby, out of all people? Why would you defend him when I asked "What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?" I am struggling to even comprehend why you would defendâ€¦ no, why would you even say that you love Gatsby. Look at him, Gatsby is a bootlegger - he sells goods illegally, or he is a murderer! No one really knows his past history. Compare him to me, my bloodline and my riches. No one in their right mind would choose Gatsby, nevertheless be connected to him in any form. I know, I had my "affair" with Myrtle, but that was different. I was just a little bored, and of course, you are my wife, and I would not leave you for her. Plus, that really doesn't really matter now, since you killed her. I gave you everything that you asked for from the start. Remember when I gave you the string of pearls? And do not forget about Pammy. I can guarantee you, you will see through the facade that Gatsby has set up. I know you will know who is right and that you will come back to me.

Tom Buchanan
