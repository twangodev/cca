## The Blade

The blade falls, and another will be gone<br>
A solution for all the angry<br>
The ending for some who did not do wrong<br>

Whatever happens cannot be undone<br>
All thanks to the revolutionary<br>
The blade falls, and another will be gone<br>

The ideas of fear and death will daunt<br>
Those who are innocent/beg for mercy<br>
The ending for some who did not do wrong<br>

Authority has been reduced to none<br>
And in the chaos it's all just crazy<br>
The blade falls, and another will be gone<br>

The terrible deeds that will have been done<br>
As a result of this machinery<br>
The ending for some who did not do wrong<br>

All of its operations are history<br>
Recalled as the machine devilry<br>
The blade falls, and another will be gone<br>
The ending for some who did not do wrong<br>
