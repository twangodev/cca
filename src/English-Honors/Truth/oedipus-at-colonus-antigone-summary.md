# Oedipus at Colonus & Antigone Summary

Oedipus at Colonus, the sequel to Oedipus Rex, describes the story of Oedipus' end. It's a couple years after Oedipus' exile, and the story begins by introducing the audience to Oedipus and his daughter Antigone, who have been wandering around as beggars. The two rest and realize that they are in a grove near Athens. Unbeknownst to them, this grove, Colonus, is sacred to the Furies, and a local tells them to get out of the sacred grove. Oedipus tells the stranger that he has a message for Theseus, the ruler of Athens. It is revealed that Oedipus' burial city will bring the city good fortune. The Chorus arrive, and they are furious that Oedipus is in the sacred grove. They bring him outside the grove and interrogate him, where they become even more enraged after realizing Oedipus killed his own father and married his mother. However Oedipus protests and claims that his very presence will help Athens and its people. Ismene, Oedipus' second daughter, suddenly arrives and informs Oedipus that his two sons, Polynices and Eteocles, are at war with each other over the Thebe's throne. It is also important to note that an oracle has prophesied the winner of the war will house Oedipus' burial site. Because of this, Creon plans to come to Athens to kill Oedipus, in the hopes that neither Polynices or Eteocles will become king of Thebes. Theseus finally arrives and grants Oedipus his protection and Athenian citizenship, and in return Oedipus offers to be buried in Athens, since it guarantees Athens to win any conflict between Thebes. Creon arrives and attempts to lure Oedipus to Thebes, but an argument spawns between the two before Creon says he captured both of Oedipus' daughters. Theseus comes in and orders Creon to bring his daughters back. Polynices arrives and begs Oedipus to side with him, as Eteocles has sent 7 armies after him, but Oedipus refuses and Polynices accepts his fate of death. Zeus then sends a clap of thunder, signaling that his doom is approaching, so Oedipus prepares a spot for himself to die. Theseus watches as Oedipus dies, and the Oedipus' daughters return to Thebes to prevent the brothers' deaths.

Antigone begins by introducing the audience with the events after Oedipus at Colonus. Argos has conquered Thebes, and Oedipus' two sons, Polynices and Eteocles have died in combat. Creon is now the king of Thebes, and Oedipus' daughters are upset over the deaths of their brothers. Because Polynices fought against Thebes, Creon decrees a law so that Polynices will not be granted any funeral rites, whoever interferes will get stoned to death. Antigone plans to bury Polynices, even if it risks her death, because she believes that the gods would like to have funeral rites for every person. Ismene does not want to take part in this, saying that the family has already suffered enough. Antigone is then caught burying her brother as is brought before Creon, and Creon gives her the death sentence. Haemon, who is not only Creon's son but also engaged with Antigone, does not agree with the sentence. Creon and Haemon get into an argument, and Haemon is disowned by his father. Tiresias appears, warning Creon that the gods are mad. Creon initially accuses Tiresias of being bribed, similar to Creon accusing Oedipus in Oedipus Rex, but realizes that Tiresias is being serious. By the time Creon gets to the cave where he sentenced Antigone, he witnesses his son's death. By the time Creon comes back to the palace carrying his dead son, he finds out his wife has killed himself. Creon finally realizes that all of this was his fault, and Antigone ends with the Chorus singing about being humble.
