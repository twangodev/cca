# Commenting
## Single Line Comments (Rems)

Whatever after the `//` operator will become a comment within the single line

```java
System.out.println("Hello!"); // This line prints "Hello!"
```

## Block Comments (Block Rems)

To have multi-line comments without using the `//` operator on each line, use the `/* <comment> */` syntax

```java
public class HelloWorld {

	/* This is my first line
	This is my second line
	Goodbye! */
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println("Wow!");
	}

}
```
