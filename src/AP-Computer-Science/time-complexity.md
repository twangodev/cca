# Time Complexity

Big O-notation is the use of the function $O$ to decscibe the behavior of steps a function will take as input grows

## Constant: $O(1)$

## Linear: $O(n)$

## Logarithmic: $O(\log n)$

### Binary Search

To find the amount of steps required for the worst case can be described with this equation: $\log_2 n$, where `n` is the number of elements in a sorted list

## Quadratic: $O(n^2)$

## Exponential: $O(2^n)$
