# Contrast

- After identifying the subject of the poem, we must identify the speaker, who provides the poem's "voice"
- We view the world through the speaker's perspective. Don't jump to the conclusion that the speaker and author are the same
- Usually the speaker is a **persona**, character created by the poet to communicate a particular mood, purpose, or attitude about particular story at a particular time

## Juxtapositions
Placing two words or concepts side by side, often to emphasize their incongruity. Reveals the speaker's attitude toward a subject

## Antithesis
Contradictory ideas/words in parallel grammatical structure

## Paradox
Words that appear to contradict each other but offer a deeper meaning

## Oxymoron
Two seemingly contradictory words that are right next to each other.
