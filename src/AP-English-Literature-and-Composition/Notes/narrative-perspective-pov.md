# Narrative Perspective & Point of View
All focuses on who tells the story, how they tell it,
and how they and we, as readers, understand their roles in the narrative

## Point of View
The position from which a narrator relates the events of a narrative

### First Person
Uses first-person pronouns such as I and we.
See the story through the lens of one character.
Usually the main character, though, it could be a minor one too.

### Second Person
Puts the reader directly into the story; rarely used, could be viewed as gimmicky because it  makes the reading too literal. However, it can create intimacy

### Third Person
Tells the story with third-person pronouns—he, she, and it. View all events from a distance.

#### Limited
Views all events from one person's perspective; good insight into how that character views the world

#### Omniscient
Views and knows events from the perspectives of multiple characters.

#### Objective
Most neutral and impartial. Does not follow a single character or enter one's perspective. Don't know what characters are thinking or feeling.

## Stream of Consciousness
Narrative technique that takes readers inside the mind of a narrator, recounting thoughts,
impressions, and feelings, from either a first person or a third-person limited omniscient perspective

- Get a sense of what the narrator is thinking without filters, causalty, or logic
- Often characterized by fragments, swift or absent transitions, and a free association of ideas
- Generally going to see this in longer fiction because there is more room for the story and this type of technique

## Layerd Points of View
Not every story has a straightforward first, second, or third-person point of view.
It's often old through multiple layered perspectives.

- Sometimes we have multiple narrators—different characters move plot forward, each picking up where the other left off.
- Different characters relate the same events from their own perspectives, giving a more complicated and nuanced understanding of their meaning.

## Narrative Frames
Establishes who is telling the main story and under what circumstances

- Create a shift in perspective
- Usually, a thematic link between the frame and the main narrative
- If the frame story is told in first-person present tense, perhaps the main story will be told as a flashback or in third-person as something that happened to someone else
- When a frame is used to pass on a secondhand story, the reader is left to wonder if the narrator is getting everything right, or if they are misremembering or embellishing a tale

## Unreliable Narrators
Sometimes authors will tell teh perspective through a character who is naive,
biased, mentally ill, corrupt, or simply just immoral

- USe to create tension as readers try to determine what is true or fact and what is downright false or a matter of perspective
- Unreliable narrators are often interesting, complex characters who may have an inherited bias or some blindspots that create a subjective viewpoint
