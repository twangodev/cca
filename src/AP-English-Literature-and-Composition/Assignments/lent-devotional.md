# Lent Devotional

## Day 1: Ash Wednesday

1. Why is it so easy to get caught up in earthly validation? What are the finite treasures that you often store in search of that validation?

    It's easy to seek earthly validation because it's immediate and visible, like likes on social media or getting good grades. These are finite treasures I chase for validation.

2. What does authentic faith look like to you? In what ways are we like the hypocrites that Christ rebukes in Matthew 6? How can we take steps toward contentment and authenticity during Lent as we wait for the Easter event?

    Authentic faith to me looks like genuinely caring and helping others, not just showing off at church or youth group. We're like the hypocrites when we do things just to be seen as "good" without truly believing or understanding why. During Lent, I guess we can try to be more real with ourselves about why we do what we do, maybe spend a little time thinking about our actions and their reasons beyond just looking good to others.

## Day 2: Lenten Reflection

1. Have you ever tried meditation and thinking about the presence of God on your own and in what ways is he guiding you?

    I've tried meditation a couple of times, mostly because my friends said it was cool. I guess thinking about God's presence is kind of calming, but it's hard to see how He's guiding me when I'm so busy with school and everything.

2. How has seeking God's guidance and meditating on His Word brought clarity and peace to our life during challenging times?

    When I actually take a moment to seek God's guidance or think about what I've heard in church, it does make things feel less chaotic. It's like having a moment of quiet in the middle of a storm, even if I don't do it as often as I probably should.
