# Lent Devotional

## Ash Wednesday

1. Why is it so easy to get caught up in earthly validation? What are the finite treasures that you often store in search of that validation?

    It's easy to seek earthly validation because it's immediate and visible, like likes on social media or getting good grades. These are finite treasures I chase for validation.

2. What does authentic faith look like to you? In what ways are we like the hypocrites that Christ rebukes in Matthew 6? How can we take steps toward contentment and authenticity during Lent as we wait for the Easter event?

    Authentic faith to me looks like genuinely caring and helping others, not just showing off at church or youth group. We're like the hypocrites when we do things just to be seen as "good" without truly believing or understanding why. During Lent, I guess we can try to be more real with ourselves about why we do what we do, maybe spend a little time thinking about our actions and their reasons beyond just looking good to others.

1. Have you ever tried meditation and thinking about the presence of God on your own and in what ways is he guiding you?

    I've tried meditation a couple of times, mostly because my friends said it was cool. I guess thinking about God's presence is kind of calming, but it's hard to see how He's guiding me when I'm so busy with school and everything.

2. How has seeking God's guidance and meditating on His Word brought clarity and peace to our life during challenging times?

    When I actually take a moment to seek God's guidance or think about what I've heard in church, it does make things feel less chaotic. It's like having a moment of quiet in the middle of a storm, even if I don't do it as often as I probably should.

1. How can reflecting on God's attributes help you get through moments of doubt or despair in your life?

    Reflecting on God's attributes, like His kindness, strength, and understanding, reminds me that I'm not alone in my struggles. It helps me trust that there's someone bigger than my doubts and despair, guiding and supporting me, even when I don't always see it or make time to acknowledge it.

2. How has God been faithful in your life?

    Even though I don't always notice it at the moment, looking back, I can see times when things just worked out when they shouldn't have, like doing well on a test I didn't think I was prepared for or getting through tough times with friends and family. It makes me think maybe that's God being faithful, making sure I'm okay even when I'm too busy to pay attention.

1. When was the last time you were tempted?

    The last time I was tempted was probably just yesterday, scrolling through my phone instead of studying for a big test coming up. It's like every time I know I have a lot to do, my phone becomes the most interesting thing in the world.

2. How did you respond to this temptation? If you were tempted, do you regret giving in?

    I ended up giving in to the temptation and wasted a bit of time watching videos and checking social media. Yeah, I do regret it because it made me even more stressed about the test. It's a constant battle to not let distractions take over when I really need to focus.

1. How has God's responsiveness in times of trouble help to shape your relationship with God?

    It's hard to see sometimes, but when I'm really stressed or upset and I remember to ask for help, things often start to feel a bit better. It makes me think maybe God is listening, which is kind of comforting and makes me curious about getting to know Him a bit more, when I can find the time.

2. What ways are you able to participate in worshipping God with other believers in your community?

    I don't get to participate in worship as much as I'd like because of my schedule, but sometimes I join online services or listen to worship music while studying. It's not much, but it helps me feel a bit connected to my faith and community.

1. How do we continue to make sure that there is less evil and antagonism in this fallen world and continue to strive for a world promised by God?

    As a high schooler with limited time, I think small acts of kindness and understanding can go a long way. We can't fix everything, but being nicer to people around us, standing up against bullying, and helping out where we can might make our little corner of the world better. It's about doing our part, no matter how small it seems, to spread more good and less evil.

2. How do we continue to have faith in God in times of hardship fear and turmoil?

    Keeping faith in God during tough times is really hard, especially when you're overwhelmed with school, friends, and everything else. For me, it's about trying to remember the times things turned out okay in the end and believing there's a bigger plan. Sometimes, just talking to someone who understands or praying in my own way helps me feel a bit more hopeful, even if it doesn't solve everything right away.

1. Is there ever a moment where you think Go dwas not providing? If so, when?

    There have definitely been times when I've felt unsupported, not necessarily looking to a higher power for provision but more so in terms of not seeing the outcomes I've hoped for in life's challenges, like academic or personal setbacks.

2. How are you able to overcome feelings of doubt in your faith?

    Dealing with doubt, for me, isn't so much about faith in a religious sense but more about finding inner strength and resilience. I overcome these feelings by focusing on what I can control, like my effort and attitude, and by seeking support and advice from people I trust, who understand my viewpoint and struggles.

1. In what ways do you see yourself improving, whether it is mentally or spiritually, so that you can proudly embrace Jesus Lent? What obstacles do you think you will encounter?

    I'm working on being more patient and understanding, but finding the time and staying motivated are big challenges for me.

2. Do you think that peer pressure or friends of other faiths will dishearten you to behave or actin a away that is unlike what Jesus teachers you? How will you overcome them? Are you personally more likely to concede to their side or will you stand your ground?

    Peer pressure is tough, but I try to stick to my values while respecting others'. It's all about balancing my beliefs with the influences around me.

1. How did contemplating the vastness of creation deepen your appreciation for God's creation in your life?

    Even though I don't spend much time on religion, thinking about the vastness of the universe does make me appreciate the complexity and beauty of the world around us. It's pretty awe-inspiring and makes me wonder about the bigger picture.

2. How can you actively align your choices with God's commandments to experience the joy mentioned in Psalm 19:8?

    By trying to make choices that are kind and fair to others, I guess I'm aligning with the spirit of many teachings, which could bring a sense of joy and peace, similar to what's mentioned in Psalm 19:8, even if I'm not actively practicing religion.
