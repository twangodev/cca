# Redemption - George Herbert - Allegory Questions

## Prompt

- On the surface this poem tells about a business negotiation between a tenant landholder and his landlord. What clues indicate that the poem really concerns something deeper?
- Who is the "rich Lord"? Who is the tenant? What is the old lease? What is the new one? Where does the tenant find his Lord? What is the significance of his suit being granted just as the landlord dies?
- What are the implications of the landlord's having gone to take possession of some land which he "had dearly bought/Long since on earth"?  In what senses (on both levels of meaning) is the landlord of "great birth?" What is a "ragged noise and mirth/Of thieves and murderers"?

## Response

- The poem is rife with language and imagery that suggest a spiritual journey rather than a mere business transaction. The "rich Lord" is not just a landlord but represents God, and the tenant symbolizes a human soul or believer. The quest for a "new small-rented lease" symbolizes the seeking of divine grace or salvation, a new covenant with God that supersedes the old covenant of the Law, represented by the "old" lease. The tenant's journey to find the Lord in "heaven at his manor" and being told that He had gone to earth "to take possession" of land He had "dearly bought" refers to the Incarnation of Christ, who came to earth to claim what He had redeemed through His death. This is a direct allusion to the Christian belief in Jesus Christ's sacrifice for humanity's sins.
- The "rich Lord" is God, specifically Jesus Christ in the Christian tradition, who is of the highest "great birth" due to His divine nature and His incarnation as a human being. The tenant represents any human being or the collective of humanity seeking reconciliation and a new relationship with God. The old lease represents the Old Covenant between God and humanity, based on the Law given to Moses, which humans are unable to fulfill perfectly due to their sinful nature. The new lease symbolizes the New Covenant, offered through Christ's sacrifice, which offers salvation not based on the adherence to the Law but on faith and grace. The tenant finds the Lord among "thieves and murderers," which references Christ's crucifixion between two criminals. This setting underscores the Christian belief that Jesus was crucified for the sins of all, even the most despised. The granting of the tenant's suit as the Lord dies signifies the moment of Jesus's death on the cross, which, according to Christian belief, is the pivotal event that grants humanity the possibility of salvation and a new relationship with God.
- The landlord's journey to take possession of land he "had dearly bought/Long since on earth" refers to Jesus Christ's mission on earth, culminating in His crucifixionâ€”His death being the price paid for humanity's redemption. This act of redemption was planned long before (as suggested by "Long since on earth"), indicating the preexistence and foreordination of Christ's sacrificial mission. The landlord's "great birth" has a dual meaning: it refers to His divine origin as the Son of God and His incarnation, being born into the world as a human. This dual nature is central to the Christian understanding of Christ as both fully divine and fully human. The "ragged noise and mirth/Of thieves and murderers" symbolizes the crucifixion scene, where Jesus was mocked and derided by those around Him. This setting highlights the irony of the world's rejection of its Savior and the juxtaposition of Christ's kingship with His humiliating death. In summary, the poem uses the allegory of a tenant seeking a new lease from a lord to explore themes of redemption, divine grace, and the sacrificial love of Christ. It portrays the human soul's journey towards reconciliation with God, culminating in the transformative act of Christ's death, which offers a new covenant of grace to humanity.
