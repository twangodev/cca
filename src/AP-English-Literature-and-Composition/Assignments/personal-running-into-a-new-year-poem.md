## Response

i am stepping into a new year <br>
where college decisions flutter around <br>
like leaves in a whirlwind <br>
each a fragment of a future untold <br>
whispering promises like <br>
coded messages in lines of possibility <br>
and it feels like standing <br>
at the edge of a vast sea <br>
the horizon dotted with what ifs and maybes <br>
when i think of robotics my heart races <br>
like a machine its gears turning <br>
fast and relentless each challenge <br>
a puzzle a joy a test of spirit <br>
but as team captain i am the compass <br>
guiding through storms and still waters alike <br>

- Personification: "college decisions flutter around like leaves in a whirlwind" and "whispering promises"
- Metaphor: Comparing the uncertainty and potential of the future to "standing at the edge of a vast sea"
