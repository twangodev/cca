# Allusion Texts

Journey of the Magi, Genesis, and A Little East of Jordan

## Prompt

- Read the following three poems and answer the corresponding questions for each poem.
- Then write a complex claim – one that addresses two texts – and describes how the use of allusion contributes to the nuanced interpretation of the poems as a whole. 

## Response

### Journey of the Magi
1. The biblical account of the journey of the Magi, or wise men, to Bethlehem is given in Matthew 2:1-12 and has since been elaborated by numerous legendary accretions. It has been made familiar through countless pageants and Christmas cards. How does this account differ from the familiar one? Compare it with the biblical account. What has been added? What has been left out? What is the poet doing? (Lines 1-5 are in quotation marks because they are taken, with very slight modification, from a Christmas sermon [1622] by the Anglican bishop Lancelot Andrewes.)

    The account in "Journey of the Magi" significantly differs from the biblical narrative by focusing on the hardships and existential reflections of the Magi, rather than the miraculous and joyful aspects typically emphasized. The poem adds details about the physical and emotional difficulties of the journey, such as the harsh weather, the discomfort of the camels, and the unfriendly towns. It omits the biblical emphasis on the star guiding them and the joy of finding Jesus. The poet, T.S. Eliot, uses this perspective to explore themes of faith, sacrifice, and transformation, contrasting the idealized versions of the story with a more nuanced and humanized portrayal.

2. Who is the speaker? Where and when is he speaking? What is the "old dispensation" (41) to which he refers, and why are the people "alien" (42)? Why does he speak of the "Birth" (38) as being "like Death" (39)? Of whose "Birth" and "Death" is he speaking? How does his life differ from the life he lived before his journey? What does he mean by saying that he would be "glad of another death" (43)?

    The speaker is one of the Magi, reflecting back on the journey from a distant future. He speaks in a time and place far removed from the events of the journey, likely in his own country, which feels alien to him after his transformative experience. The "old dispensation" refers to the pre-Christian world order, and the people are "alien" because the speaker's encounter with the Christ child has fundamentally changed his worldview, making his former life seem foreign. He speaks of the "Birth" as being "like Death" because it signifies the end of his old life and beliefs; the birth of Christ is a pivotal event that leads to a spiritual death and rebirth for the Magi. The reference to desiring "another death" suggests a longing for the complete transformation and renewal of self that comes with true faith.

3. This poem was written while the poet was undergoing religious conversion. (Eliot published it in 1927, the year he was confirmed in the Anglican Church.) Could the poem be considered a parable of the conversion experience? If so, how does this account differ from popular conceptions of this experience?

    "Journey of the Magi" can indeed be seen as a parable of the conversion experience, with the physical journey mirroring the spiritual journey of conversion. Unlike the often idealized and sudden conversion experiences popularly conceived, Eliot's poem portrays conversion as a difficult, painful process that involves letting go of the old self and embracing a new, often uncertain, spiritual path. This account emphasizes the struggles and doubts that accompany true transformation, suggesting that genuine faith requires sacrifice and may not bring immediate peace or joy.

4. How do the images in the second section differ from those of the first? Do any of them suggest connections with the life of Christ?

    The images in the second section of the poem, which describe the arrival in a temperate valley and the subsequent events, contrast sharply with the harshness and desolation of the first part. These images, such as the "running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness," the "three trees on the low sky," and the "old white horse galloped away in the meadow," evoke a sense of peace and natural beauty. They suggest connections with the life of Christ, particularly the three trees which can be interpreted as a foreshadowing of the Crucifixion. These images hint at the redemption and transformation that the birth of Christ brings into the world, aligning with the themes of death and rebirth that permeate the poem.

### Genesis
1. Find the passages in the book of Genesis to which this poem alludes. Would you call the allusions serious or playful, or both?

   The poem alludes to the creation story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis, specifically to the parts where Eve is created from Adam's rib (Genesis 2:21-22) and the story of Noah's Ark (though the Ark itself and the giraffes are not in the Genesis creation narrative, but in the story of Noah in Genesis chapters 6-9). The allusions can be considered both serious and playful: serious in their engagement with foundational religious narratives, but playful in their imaginative reinterpretation and casual, speculative tone, particularly the idea of reversing the creation order and including giraffes sticking their necks out of the ark.

2. Describe the relationship between the speaker and his partner.

   The relationship between the speaker and his partner appears to be deeply intimate and affectionate, with a significant emphasis on emotional and intellectual connection. Their interaction is marked by shared speculation, playful conversation, and a deep appreciation for each other's qualities, as seen in the appreciation for a "flexible mind" and the tender act of counting ribs in a moment of closeness. This closeness is not just physical but also intellectual and emotional.

3. Most of this poem about the romantic relationship is set in the past. Why is this appropriate?

   Setting most of the poem in the past is appropriate because it reflects on the development and deepening of the relationship over time. This temporal perspective allows the speaker to recount the progression of their bond from a shared intimate moment to a deeper, reflective connection in the present. It highlights the evolution of love and intimacy, suggesting that the memories and experiences shared in the past are foundational to their current relationship and understanding of each other.

### A Little East of Jordan

1. Discuss the biblical allusion in this poem. Does Dickinson hold fast to the biblical account or does she use it for her own purposes?

   The poem references the biblical story of Jacob wrestling with an angel (or God) in Genesis 32:22-32, but Emily Dickinson employs the event for her own artistic purposes, blending the sacred with the accessible through her unique choice of words like "Gymnast" for Jacob and the informal setting of a "Breakfast" negotiation. This approach suggests a reinterpretation rather than a strict adherence to the biblical narrative, making the divine encounter more personal and immediate.

2. In what sense has the "Gymnast" (15) "worsted God" (16)?

   The "Gymnast" has "worsted God" in the sense that Jacob, through his persistence and refusal to let go without a blessing, triumphs in a moral or spiritual sense, convincing the divine being to grant him a blessing. This is not a physical overcoming but a metaphorical victory, showcasing the power of human determination and faith.

3. Is the poem lighthearted or serious, or somewhere in between?

   The poem straddles the line between being lighthearted and serious, infusing a profound biblical event with a touch of whimsy through the depiction of the wrestling as a breakfast-time tussle, yet it maintains a sense of gravity in its exploration of faith, struggle, and transformation. Dickinson's tone allows the reader to contemplate the depth of the biblical story while enjoying her imaginative and slightly irreverent take on it.

### Claim

Through the strategic use of biblical allusions, T.S. Eliot's "Journey of the Magi" and Emily Dickinson's "A Little East of Jordan" intricately weave layers of spiritual and existential inquiry into the fabric of their narratives, challenging readers to explore the profound intersections of faith, sacrifice, and transformation inherent in the human condition.
