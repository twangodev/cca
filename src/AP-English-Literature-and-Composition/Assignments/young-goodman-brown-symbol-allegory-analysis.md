# Allegory and Symbolism in "Young Goodman Brown" by Nathaniel Hawthorne

An **ALLEGORY** is a story in which everything is a **SYMBOL.** An Allegory has two meanings: a literal one and a symbolic one. The symbolic meaning contains moral, social, religious, or political significance, and characters are often personifications of abstract ideas, such as charity or greed.

Choose FIVE significant people or items from the story, identify what larger concept he/she/it stands for, and then provide textual evidence to support your interpretation

| Symbol                       | What it stands for                                                                                                                                                                           | Evidence from the story                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Goodman Brown                | Goodman Brown symbolizes the everyman, representing the common individual confronting the moral and ethical challenges of life                                                               | His inner turmoil and doubt reflect the universal struggle with sin and temptation: "My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor his father before him. We have been a race of honest men and good Christians since the days of the martyrs." |
| Faith (Goodman Brown's Wife) | As suggested by her name, Faith represents religious belief and innocence. She embodies the pure, untainted side of Goodman Brown's conscience and the moral values he holds dear.           | "With Heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against the devil!" This statement underscores Goodman Brown's reliance on his faith to resist temptation.                                                                                         |
| The Forest                   | The forest is a manifestation of the unknown, the subconscious, and the inherent darkness within humanity. It's a place where Goodman Brown confronts his deepest fears and moral challenges | "He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest." The forest's description sets a sinister tone, indicating its allegorical nature as a place of moral testing.                                                               |
| The Dark Figure/Devil        | This figure symbolizes the embodiment of temptation, evil, and the darker aspects of human nature                                                                                            | The staff he carries, "which bore the likeness of a great black snake," is reminiscent of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, emphasizing his malicious intentions and deceptive nature.                                                                      |
| Goody Cloyse                 | Representing a revered, pious figure in the community, Goody Cloyse's presence in the forest and alliance with the devil underscores the theme of hidden sin and hypocrisy                   | "That old woman taught me my catechism!" Goodman Brown's exclamation at seeing Goody Cloyse in the forest emphasizes the shock and betrayal he feels upon witnessing the duality of human nature.                                                            |
