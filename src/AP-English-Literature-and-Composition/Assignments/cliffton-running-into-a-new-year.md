# Cliffton Running Into a New Year

## Prompt
Write down 5 observations (form, structure, poetic elements, etc. and how they help us interpret the poem as a whole). 

## Response
- Train of thought: Random structure, glimpses in time
- Repetition: "I am running into a new year" - emphasis into the fact of moving on
- Aging: 16, 26, and 36 are used as milestones to show how time passes quickly
- Personification: "that i catch in my hair like strong fingers like" Tangible past
- Reflective tone: Asks for forgiveness and continues to move on
