# Hills Like White Elephants POV Questions

## Prompt

1. The main topic of discussion between the man and the girl is never named. What is the "awfully simple operation"? Why
   is it not named? What different attitudes are taken toward it by the man and the girl? Why?

2. Though the story consists mostly of dialogue, and though it contains strong emotional conflict, it is entirely
   without adverbs, indicating tone of remarks. How does Hemingway indicate tone? Where do you see the characters being
   insincere? Ironic or sarcastic?

3. Much of the conversation seems to be about trivial things (ordering drinks, the weather, etc.). What purposes does
   this conversation serve? What relevance does the girl's remark about Absinthe have?

4. What is the point of the comparison of the hills to white elephants? Why does the author use it as a title?

5. Which character seems more reasonable? Who "wins" the conflict?

6. According to the definitions presented in the book, what is the point of view used in this story?

## Response

1. The operation being discussed is strongly implied to be an abortion, although the term is never explicitly used. The
   absence of the term may serve to heighten the tension and uncertainty between the characters, reflecting societal
   taboos or the couple's own discomfort in facing the issue directly. The man seems to trivialize the operation,
   calling it "awfully simple," likely in an attempt to persuade Jig to go through with it. Jig appears to be more
   ambivalent and possibly more aware of the emotional and moral complexity of the decision.

2. Hemingway uses other techniques to indicate tone, including the characters' actions and what they choose to say or
   not say. The lack of adverbs forces the reader to infer tone from context, making the dialogue more open to
   interpretation. Insincerity is evident when the man insists he wants Jig to do what she wants, while his continued
   pressure indicates he has a preferred outcome. Moments of irony or sarcasm occur when Jig makes remarks like, "Then
   I'll do it. Because I don't care about me."

3. The conversation about drinks and the weather serves as a diversion and a way to manage the tension and emotional
   gravity of the real issue at hand. It also serves to contrast the mundane aspects of life with the life-changing
   decision they are facing. Jig's remark about Absinthe—another strong alcohol—may indicate a desire for escape or
   numbness, given the weight of the decision she's facing.

4. The comparison of the hills to white elephants serves as a metaphor for the situation the couple finds themselves
   in—facing an issue that is large, hard to ignore, but also hard to talk about directly. The term "white elephant"
   generally refers to something that is more of a burden than a blessing, which could apply to how the characters are
   viewing the potential child or even their relationship. The title serves to encapsulate the emotional and symbolic
   weight of the story.

5. Reasonableness is subjective and depends on one's viewpoint on the issue. The man seems to be logical but emotionally
   detached, while Jig appears more emotionally tuned into the complexity of the situation. Neither clearly "wins" the
   conflict; the story ends ambiguously, and the power dynamics are left unresolved.

6. The point of view used in "Hills Like White Elephants" is third-person limited objective. The narrator reports the
   events and dialogue without providing direct insight into the characters' thoughts or feelings, leaving it to the
   reader to interpret the emotional nuances.
