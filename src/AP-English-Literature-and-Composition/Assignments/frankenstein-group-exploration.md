# Frankenstein Group Explorations

## Prompt
Was Victor Frankenstein a victim? Explain. Find evidence to support both sides of the argument.

## Response

Yes. Frankenstein's original intention with creating the monster did not consider the fact that the monster would go out to kill his family. So Frankenstein is a victim, even though he was one who originally created of the monster. You can also say that Frankenstein is a victim to his own pride - since Frankenstein does not inform his family members or anyone else of his creation, and most importantly take responsibility of the monster due to fear of being judged, or facing repercussions.
