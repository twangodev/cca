| "A man who has no conscience, no goodness, does not suffer."                   | Question: Does this suggest that suffering is intrinsic to having a moral compass? It raises questions about the nature of guilt and conscience, and whether the ability to feel pain over our actions is what truly makes us human.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| "War doesn't negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace." | Evaluate: This quote challenges the notion that war justifies moral lapses. It asserts that in times of conflict, maintaining our humanity and decency is even more critical, serving as a critique of how individuals and societies justify their actions in war.                                                                                                                                                                          |

When you finish, share your answers with a classmate. How did their answers differ from yours?

### Potential Symbol

- The Pomegranate Tree
- Lambs
- Blood
- Kites
- Hassan's Harelip
- The Monster in the Lake

### Evidence and Commentary

#### The Pomegranate Tree
The pomegranate tree represents Amir and Hassan's broken friendship. It goes from a symbol of their bond to a reminder of betrayal when Amir considers, and then acts upon, hurting Hassan with a pomegranate. This tree, once a symbol of their unity, becomes tainted with the act of violence, showing how their relationship has deteriorated, much like the overripe fruit on the ground.

#### Lambs
Lambs symbolize sacrifice and lost innocence, especially in relation to Hassan. Amir sees Hassan as a sacrifice he has to make to gain Baba's approval, likening him to a lamb that needs to be slaughtered. This idea ties to the concept of sacrificing something pure for personal gain, reflecting Amir's moral failure and the cost of his actions on their friendship.

#### Blood
Blood represents violence, guilt, and social division. In one scene, Amir's act of throwing pomegranates at Hassan, causing him to bleed, symbolizes not just physical violence but the deeper wounds of betrayal and societal prejudice. Blood is a recurring reminder of the pain and division caused by both personal betrayals and wider societal conflicts.
