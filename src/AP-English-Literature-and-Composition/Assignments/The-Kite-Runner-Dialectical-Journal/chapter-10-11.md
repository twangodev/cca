| Type of Contrast                                     | Textual Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Significance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Amir and Hassan                                      | Amir is a privileged Pashtun boy, whereas Hassan is a Hazara and Amir's servant. Despite their close friendship, Amir often struggles with the societal implications of their bond, leading to feelings of guilt and conflict, especially after failing to protect Hassan from abuse.                   | This contrast underscores the theme of class and ethnic divisions in Afghanistan. It highlights the deeply ingrained prejudices and injustices in Afghan society. The contrast also drives the novel's central conflict of Amir's journey towards redemption, as he grapples with the consequences of his childhood choices and the societal norms that influenced them.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Afghanistan and America                              | The novel contrasts life in Kabul, Afghanistan, with life in California, USA. Kabul is portrayed as a place of Amir's childhood memories, marked by both beauty and violence, while California represents a place of exile and new beginnings.                                                          | This contrast explores themes of identity and belonging. For Amir and Baba, America offers a chance to escape the turmoil of their home country, but it also brings the challenges of assimilation and nostalgia for a lost homeland. This setting contrast also highlights the cultural and social contexts of immigrant experiences, particularly the struggles of adapting to a new world while holding on to one's cultural heritage.                                                                                 |
| Traditional Values vs. Modern/Individualistic Values | Baba's traditional Afghan values, which emphasize honor, pride, and reputation, often clash with the more individualistic and less formal values prevalent in American society. Amir's pursuit of a writing career, for example, is met with skepticism by Baba, who values more practical professions. | This contrast serves to explore the conflicts between traditional and modern values, especially in the context of immigration and cultural assimilation. It speaks to the broader theme of the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, and the generational divide in perceptions of success, duty, and personal fulfillment. This contrast also shapes Amir's character development as he navigates between these two value systems, seeking his father's approval while also trying to pursue his own aspirations. |
