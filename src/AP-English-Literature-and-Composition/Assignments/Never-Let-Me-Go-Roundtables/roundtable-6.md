## Quotes
- "As we stood there, looking out at the vast sea, with the boat in the distance, I realized there was no going back. The silence between us spoke volumes, and all I could muster was a feeble attempt at reassurance, saying: 'It’s all right, we still have time.' But the hollow words faded into the air, leaving a heavy weight of unspoken truths."
- "For a moment, it seemed as if they were about to disclose something monumental, but then, gathering themselves, they simply remarked on the unpredictability of the sea and how it's much like our own lives—unpredictable and often uncontrollable. 'You get lost out there if you're not careful,' they said, a statement that lingered ominously in the air."
