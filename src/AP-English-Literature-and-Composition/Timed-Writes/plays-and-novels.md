# Plays and Novels

## Prompt

Many plays and novels employ a character whose absence is especially significant. Such a character often serves as an important foil to the main character(s). Select a play from the list above (the one you were assigned), and in a well-written paragraph analyze the which in which an absent character illuminates the motives and actions of one or more focal characters, and how the absent character contributes to the meaning of the play as a whole.

## Response

In Susan Glaspell's play "Trifles," the absent character of Mrs. Wright (previously known as Minnie Foster) is pivotal. Her absence is deeply felt throughout the narrative, as it is her life and experiences that form the central mystery. The other characters, particularly the women, discover and interpret clues about Mrs. Wright's life, which reveal her loneliness and oppression. These findings lead them to empathize with her, despite her suspected crime. Mrs. Wright's character, though unseen, is a powerful foil to the other women, highlighting the societal constraints and struggles they face. Her presence, while physically absent, is crucial in understanding the play's themes of gender roles, isolation, and the consequences of societal neglect. Mrs. Wright's character shapes the narrative and underscores the play's message about the unseen and undervalued lives of women in society.
