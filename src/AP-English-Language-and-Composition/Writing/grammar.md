## Appositives

Noun or noun phrase that tells you more about a nearby noun or pronoun

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Itâ€™s a conflict I know well: I left my home state, **Ohio**, for the marine Corps when I was 19

And yet we continue to give the most help to those who least need it - **affluent homeowners** - while providing nothing to most rent-burdened tenants

That is one of the best things about this country: **the power of free words**

</aside>

### Punctuation Rules

- If the appositive is not essential to the meaning of the sentence but is an aside or parenthetical remark, then the writer should use punctuation to set off the appositive
- If the appositive occurs before the noun it describes, set it off with a comma

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ **A completely enjoyable pastime,** road biking is on the increase

    </aside>

- If the appositive occurs in the middle of the sentence, set it off on both sides with the same punctuation - either dashes or commas
- Dashes: more striking form of punctuation - tend to add emphasis to the appositive
- If the apposite occurs at the end of the sentence, you can set it off with a comma, a dash (for extra emphasis), or a colon
    - The colon is necessary if the appositive following the sentence consists of a list of items
