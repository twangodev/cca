# Staking a Claim

- Every argument has a claim (assertion or proposition) that states the arguments main idea or position
- Differs form a optic or subject because it must be arguable
- It must state a position that people might agree or disagree with
- Evaluate whether it is arguable or too easily verifiable to develop into an effective argument

## Types of Claims

### Claims of Fact

Assert that is something true or not true

- Are arguable when they are questioned, raise controversy, or challenge a person’s beliefs

### Claims of Value

Argue that something is good or bad, right or wrong, desirable or undesirable

- Judgements based on taste or more object evaluations based on external criteria
- Claim based on taste. What is the criteria for “best”? What defines subjective terms used?

### Claims of Policy

Any claim that argues and proposed a claim

- Usually calls for direct action to take place, but it could be recommendation for a change in attitude or viewpoint

Begin with a definition of the problem (claim of fact), explain why it is a problem (claim of value) and then explain the change that needs to happen (claim of policy)
