## Response

I think Tillman’s view of Christianity has multiple interpretations. To some, it seems as if his view of Christianity is almost disrespectful and troll. For example, the article begins with a quote from Tillman saying “If *Pure Comedy* was available in Christian bookstores, Christians would f***ing love me.” Additionally, it is said that Tillman also has a profane approach to asking hard questions about religion. To my understanding, the use of profanity is discouraged in a Christian environment, but Tillerman does not bat an eye. As a result, certain people may not label him as a Christian and be receptive of his astonishing approaches to religion, even though Tillerman deems himself as a Christian. Another interpretation of Tillman’s view of Christianity could be curious and genuine, shown through his line of asking hard questions. According to Strang, “He [Tillerman] likes to ask questions with no easy answers. But those questions, he insists, ‘still have value.’” When asking hard and difficult questions, it typically shows a receptive audience who is genuinely curious. If all of the questions were easy to answer - there would not be any value in exploring and growing spiritually. Tillman also says “This is intimate. If this is truly my maker, and I have an audience with this guy in the way that Christianity claims I do, am I limited to a certain conversation? Are there talking points I have to run through or can I have an intimate conversation with my God?” This brings up the ultimate questions to Christianity: should it represent a relationship with God being something intimate and personal? Or should religious belief simply have a set dialogue and agenda?

Personally I believe that Tillman’s perspective is valuable. I think being able to be curious and ask hard and difficult questions provides growth spiritually and even academically. This topic actually goes close to the topic of teacher-student interaction. For example, an ideal history teacher can go over facts, and have the students question, analyze, and develop opinions on events. Consider this to a teacher who feeds students facts and gives their own analysis - the student does not develop their own opinions. A student who questions, analyzes, and develops opinions would definitely have a better understanding of the topic and can even collaborate with others and share their thoughts. In the same way, asking questions and analysis are crucial elements in developing a strong religious stance/connection, not to mention the social aspect. For example, small groups - they prompt discussion, which allow for people as a group to learn from one another. Though Tillman’s approach and delivery is unique, especially with his choice of diction, the general view of Christianity Tillman is valuable when developing any religious stance.

As an atheist, I myself may not be able to properly represent how Christians could benefit from this. However, I do think being open to discuss and ask hard questions will tend to bring people either closer or further away from any religious stance. No matter the result, there would be growth within each person after addressing hard questions.
