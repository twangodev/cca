## Direction

The following prompt is based on the accompanying eight sources. This question requires you to synthesize a variety of sources into a coherent, well-written essay.

## Introduction

In Buffy the Vampire Slayer Joss Whedon and Rebecca Band Kirshner present one definition of love when they write “When I say, ‘I love you,‘ it’s not because I want you or because I can’t have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I’ve seen your kindness and your strength. I’ve seen the best and worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity what you are.” But it’s probably that love is more compilated than what can be captured in one quote from one TV show. What is live? Is it desire? Is it companionship? Is love merely chemical? What makes one person fall in love with another? Why is love necessary or important in relationships?

# Outline

## Thesis

Love is a complex phenomenon that arises from a combination of biological and social factors, including hormones and neurons, cultural and social influences, and personal choice and commitment, which are all crucial to understanding and sustaining loving relationships.

## Body Paragraph 1

The biological breakdown on love indicates that love is more than a social construct, but a deep neurological activity that occurs within the brain. Love all originates from the the brain,the hypothalamus releases dopamine, our bodies release nerve growth factor,  and hormoones are regulated to different levels, such as an increase in oxytocin and decrease in seratonin. This leads to humans feeling like they are in the ‘midst’ of love, such as ecstacy and excitement, emotions of connection and commitment. In reality however, it’s just a balance of all of the chemicals within our body.

## Body Paragraph 2

Love is a multifaceted concept, influenced by a variety of factors such as biology, culture, and social norms. According to Source H, a survey conducted by Pew Research found that political differences, long-distance relationships, and debt are among the top deal breakers for people in relationships. These findings suggest that societal and economic factors can play a significant role in the success of a romantic relationship. Source G, a poem by Margaret Atwood, shows the cultural and emotional dimensions of love. Margaret Atwood shows how love is not just a profession or pointless commodities, rather it is something that is brings up complex emotions. This portrayal of love shows the idea that cultural beliefs and societal expectations can shape how individuals view and experience love. Together, these Sources H and G demonstrate that love is not a one-dimensional emotion, but a social complex construct influenced by a variety of factors.

## Body Paragarph 3

Love is not only influenced by biology, culture, and social norms, but also by individual choice and commitment. Source C, an interview with philosopher Alain de Botton, emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication in maintaining a successful romantic relationship. De Botton argues that society often perpetuates unrealistic notions of love, which can lead to disappointment and disillusionment. He suggests that individuals must actively work to cultivate the qualities that sustain love, such as patience, kindness, and forgiveness. In Source F, a discussion of Kierkegaard and the Gospel of John, emphasizes the importance of personal commitment in relationships. The Gospel of John highlights the idea of selfless love, which requires individuals to put the needs of their partner before their own. This selflessness, along with the willingness to make personal sacrifices, can help build a strong and lasting relationship. Together, these sources suggest that personal choice and commitment are essential components of successful romantic relationships.

## Conclsuion

In conclusion, the concept of love is complex and multifaceted, influenced by biological, cultural, social, and personal factors. While biology plays a role in the chemical processes that lead to attraction, cultural and social influences shape our expectations of romantic relationships. Additionally, personal choice and commitment are crucial to building and maintaining successful relationships. As demonstrated by the sources cited, it is important to recognize the importance of hard work and dedication in cultivating the qualities that sustain love, and to embrace selflessness and sacrifice in building strong and lasting relationships. Ultimately, the definition and experience of love is unique to each individual, and requires a combination of these factors to be understood and appreciated.
