# AP Language Practice Rhetorical Analysis Essay

In the essay, “Walking”, Henry David Thoreau argues that the value of walking in nature has a way of maintaining mental and emotional balance. As technology has continuously evolved and increased it’s grip amongst the lives of individuals, Thoreau emphasizes in his essay about the calming and soothing aspects of separating our lives from the technology. Thoreau’s rhetorical choices of vivid diction, repetition, and stark juxtaposition are used to convey his message of the importance of reconnecting with the natural world that so many people ignore.

Throughout Thoreau’s whole essay, Thoreau uses specific language/diction to immerse the reader in the natural world which he describes to be so calm and relaxing, with examples of the names of specific plant species such as “*subdiales ambulationes [sun walks]*”, and “plantanes”. By giving his audience specific names of the plants, he not only builds rapport and ethos to have the audience deem his statements as credible, but it also displays Thoreau’s deep connection to the nature that he has been surrounded by. By mentioning these specific plant names in addition to the sensory language that Thoreau uses, he successfully immerses his audience within his vivid descriptions of the nature in which he claims should be sought after.

Thoreau also uses repetition to emphasize his points and create a sense of rhythm and momentum in his writing. He repeatedly returns to the idea that walking in nature is essential to his mental and emotional well-being, and that the modern world of houses, fences, and politics threatens to disconnect him nature. For example, he writes that "the building of houses, the cutting down of the forest and of all large trees…" and later emphasizes that "Politics is but a narrow field, and that still narrower highway yonder leads to it.” By continuously reemphasizing each of the modern issues that we have at hand, Thoreau allows for the readers to establish the connection to nature. 

In "Walking," Thoreau employs juxtaposition to create a contrast between the natural world and human society. In the beginning he says, “When we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would become of us if we walked only in a garden or a mall?” By comparing walking in the woods to walking in a garden or mall, he highlights the importance of nature and underscores the unique benefits that it offers. He also says how “I can easily walk ten, fifteen, twenty, any number of miles, commencing at my own door, without going by any house, without crossing a road except where the fox and mink do…” Thoreau also contrasts the natural world with the world of human society, emphasizing the ways in which society can disconnect individuals from nature. Through his use of juxtaposition, Thoreau creates a compelling argument for the value of walking in nature and the importance of maintaining a connection to the natural world.

Overall, Thoreau successfully employs vivid diction, repetition, and stark juxtaposition in his essay “Walking.” By mentioning specific plant species with his unique choice of diction, he not only builds credibility, but also immerses his audience into the nature that he describes. By using repetition, he emphasizes the importance of how walking in nature is valuable for society. Finally, Thoreau uses juxtaposition to contrast the natural world and human society, which allows readers to draw the connection to the importance of reconnecting to the natural world.
