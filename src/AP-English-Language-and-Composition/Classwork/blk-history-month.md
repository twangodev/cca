# BLK History Month

In Nikki Giovanni's poem for BLK History Month, she uses vivid imagery to convey the power of Black history and how it has endured throughout the ages. She paints a picture of how we can learn from the past to create a better future, and how our actions today will shape the world tomorrow.
