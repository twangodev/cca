# On Dumpster Diving Notes

In "On Dumpster Diving," Lars Eighner makes several main points and arguments about the practice of scavenging for food and other necessities in dumpsters. Some of these include:

1. Dumpster diving is a viable way of surviving for people who are homeless or on a limited budget.
2. There is a difference between "scavenging" and "dumpster diving." Scavenging refers to searching for discarded items that still have some value, while dumpster diving specifically refers to looking for food and other items in trash containers.
3. Dumpster diving can be a source of good quality food and other necessities, but it requires careful selection and inspection of items to avoid potential hazards.
4. There are certain ethical guidelines that should be followed when dumpster diving, such as not taking more than what is needed and not leaving a mess behind.
5. Society's attitude towards dumpster diving is often negative and based on stereotypes, but it is a practice that can be done with dignity and self-respect.

Overall, Eighner argues that dumpster diving is a practical and resourceful way of surviving for those in need, and that it can also challenge societal norms and prejudices about poverty and homelessness.
