    The lighthouse was built with the intention of protecting and guiding sailors. The purpose of the lighthouse was to make it easier for ships to navigate their way into the harbor, mainly at night. The lighthouse was also said to be used to set fire to enemy ships; the mirror and light had the capability to create such a thing. Along with these statements, there were other rumors that claim that at the top of the lighthouse, there was a statue in honor of Poseidon, while others claim that it was a statue of Alexander the Great or Ptolemy I. These rumors were never confirmed, but if they were true, it is said that the statue would make those entering by sea aware of who was in control of the territory
