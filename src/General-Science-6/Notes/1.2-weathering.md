# 1.2: Weathering

1. Physical Weathering
    1. Temperature Change [Ice Wedging]
        1. Water collects in cracks in rock
        2. Water freezes
        3. When frozen, it expanded, causing a crack
        4. Repeats over and over, until splitting the rock
    2. Pressure Change [Exfoliation]
        5. Pressure increases outer layers of the rock peel away
    3. Wind, Water, And Gravity [Abrasion]
        6. Wind
            1. Can blast particles away from object
        7. Water
            2. Rocks are tumbled and worn out in the running water
        8. Gravity
            3. Rocks can crack during landslides
    4. Plant Growth
        9. Root digs into a small crack in the wall
        10. Roots expands as the plant grows
        11. Bigger crack forms
2. Chemical Weathering
    5. Oxygen Reactions [Oxidation]
        12. Different atoms combine with oxygen, making new materials
    6. Acid
        13. Precipitation
            4. Acid falls from the sky, burning rocks or objects in its path
        14. Groundwater
            5. Can burn minerals away from and object, depositing them somewhere else
        15. Living Things
            6. Plants can create acids, burning away the rock
