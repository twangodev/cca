# 1.1: The Water Cycle

1. The Water Cycle: Movement of water between atmosphere, land, oceans, and living things
    1. Water Changing State
        1. Solid
            1. Sublimation: Solid → Gas
            2. Melts: Solid → Liquid
        2. Liquid
            3. Evaporation: Liquid → Gas
            4. Freezing: Liquid → Solid
        3. Gas
            5. Deposition: Gas → Solid
            6. Condensation: Gas → Liquid
    2. How Water Reaches Atmosphere
        4. Evaporation: From Earth's water
            7. 90% Happens
        5. Transpiration: Release of water vapor from plants
            8. 10% Happens
        6. Sublimation: Dry air blowing over ice
    3. What Happens to Water in Atmosphere
        7. Condensation: Dew
        8. Precipitation: When drops clump up together
    4. How Water Moves on Land
        9. Runoff: Rivers
        10. Infiltration: Water goes to ground
        11. Ice Flow: Glaciers
        12. Ocean Circulation: Winds moving water
