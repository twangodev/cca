# 1.3: Erosion and Deposition

1. Erosion: The process by which sediment and other materials are moved from one place to another
    1. Forms of Erosion
        1. Canyons & Valleys: When a flow of water through streams and rivers erode rock from the streambed
        2. Caves: Water erodes the rock, eventually forming a cave
        3. Sea Cliffs: When waves erode and undercut rock to make steep slopes
        4. Wave cut platforms: When sea cliffs erode so much that the they are flat
        5. Sea Caves: When the bottom of sea cliffs erode faster than the top
        6. Sea Arches: When a sea cave erodes all the way to the other side, forming a hole
        7. Sea stacks: When a sea arch collapses, it leaves behind pillars of rock
2. Deposition: The process by which eroded material is dropped
    2. Forms of Deposition
        8. Floodplains: When sediment is dropped over a flooded land
        9. Deltas: Streams deposit sediment in a fan-shaped pattern
        10. Alluvial Fan: A dry fan-shaped pattern of sediment
        11. Beaches: Particles can come up on a beach
