# Weathering

Weathering refers to the natural process by which rocks and minerals on the Earth's surface are broken down and altered over time. There are two primary types of weathering: physical weathering and chemical weathering.

## Physical Weathering

### Temperature Change (Ice Wedging)
- Water collects in cracks within rock.
- Water freezes, expanding and causing the crack to widen.
- This process repeats over time, eventually splitting the rock.

### Pressure Change (Exfoliation)
- Increased pressure can cause the outer layers of rock to peel away.

### Wind, Water, and Gravity (Abrasion)
- **Wind**: Wind can blast particles away from objects, gradually wearing them down.
- **Water**: Rocks are tumbled and worn out as they are transported in running water.
- **Gravity**: Rocks can crack during landslides, contributing to their breakdown.

### Plant Growth
- Plant roots can penetrate small cracks in rocks.
- As the plant grows, its roots expand, causing the cracks to widen and break apart the rock.

## Chemical Weathering

### Oxygen Reactions (Oxidation)
- Different atoms within minerals combine with oxygen, resulting in the formation of new materials.

### Acid
- **Precipitation**: Acidic rain falls from the sky, chemically reacting with and eroding rocks or objects in its path.
- **Groundwater**: Groundwater can dissolve minerals from one location and deposit them elsewhere.

### Living Things
- Some plants can release acids, which contribute to the chemical weathering of rocks, gradually breaking them down over time.
