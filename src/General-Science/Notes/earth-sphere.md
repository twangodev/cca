# Earth's Sphere

### Earth System
- All the matter, energy, and processes within Earth's boundary
- Consists of non-living & living things.
    - Example: Living things - Trees, animals, and people
    - Example: Non-living things - Rocks, air, and water
- Composed of 5 main parts

### Geosphere
- Mostly solid, rocky part of Earth
- Extends from the center of Earth
- Consists of 3 different layers
    - Crust
        - 5 - 10 km thick (oceanic)
        - 35 - 70 km thick (continental)
        - Least dense
    - Mantle
        - 2,900 km thick
        - More dense than the crust
    - Core
        - 3,500 km thick
        - Most dense

### Hydrosphere
- The part of Earth that is liquid water
- Includes marshes, ponds, lakes, water droplets, and rain

### Cryosphere
- The part made up of all the frozen water on Earth.
- Includes ice, sea ice, glaciers, ice shelves, and icebergs

### Atmosphere
- Mostly made up of invisible gases that surround Earth.
- Extends 500 - 600 km above the Earth's surface
- Components:
    - 78% nitrogen
    - 21% oxygen
    - 1% other gases, including argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor

### Biosphere
- The part of Earth made up of living things and the areas of Earth where they are found
- Supported by rocks, soil, oceans, lakes, rivers, and the lower atmosphere
- Most organisms require water, oxygen, or carbon dioxide to live

## Interactions Between Spheres

### Exchanging Matter
- Earth's spheres interact as matter moves between spheres
- Example: Atmosphere → Hydrosphere or Cryosphere → clouds

### Exchanging Energy
- Earth's spheres also interact as energy moves between them
- Example: Plants use solar energy to generate food

## Source of Earth's Energy

- Almost all of Earth's energy comes from the sun.

## Energy Budget

- A way to keep track of energy transfers into and out of the Earth system
- Unbalancing the budget can cause an increase or decrease in global temperatures, as well as an increase in greenhouse gases, leading to the loss of polar ice caps.

## Statistics

### Energy Coming In
- 26% Reflected by clouds & atmosphere
- 4% Reflected by the surface
- 19% Absorbed by clouds and atmosphere
- 51% absorbed by Earth

### Outgoing Energy
- 64% radiated from atmosphere and clouds (19% came from absorption)
- 7% lost as heat rising through the air
- 23% evaporated from Earth to clouds
- 6% radiated from Earth to space

## Weather and Atmospheric Conditions

### Weather
- **Definition:** The condition of Earth's atmosphere.
- **Characteristics:** Weather includes various factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind patterns.

### Temperature
- **Definition:** The measure of how hot or cold something is.
- **Measurement:** Typically measured using a thermometer.

### Humidity
- **Definition:** The amount of water vapor in the air.
- **Measurement:** Usually measured using a psychrometer, which calculates relative humidity.

### Precipitation
- **Definition:** The stuff falling from the sky, often in the form of water (H2O) in various forms like rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
- **Measurement:** Measured using a rain gauge.

### Clouds
- **Definition:** Collections of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.
- **Types:**
    - **Cirrus:** Resemble feathers and often indicate fair weather.
    - **Cumulus:** Puffy, heap-like clouds.
    - **Stratus:** Low-altitude clouds that appear like a spread of butter across the sky.

### Fog
- **Definition:** Fog is a type of low-lying cloud that forms near the ground.

## The Water Cycle

### Introduction
- The water cycle refers to the continuous movement of water between the atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms on Earth.

### Water Changing State
#### Solid
- **Sublimation**: Solid → Gas
- **Melting**: Solid → Liquid

#### Liquid
- **Evaporation**: Liquid → Gas
- **Freezing**: Liquid → Solid

#### Gas
- **Deposition**: Gas → Solid
- **Condensation**: Gas → Liquid

### How Water Reaches the Atmosphere
- **Evaporation**: Water evaporates from Earth's surface into the atmosphere, with approximately 90% of this process occurring from water bodies like oceans and lakes.
- **Transpiration**: Plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration, accounting for approximately 10% of water entering the atmosphere.
- **Sublimation**: In dry conditions, water can sublimate directly from ice into vapor when exposed to dry air blowing over ice surfaces.

### What Happens to Water in the Atmosphere
- **Condensation**: When water vapor in the atmosphere cools and changes back into liquid form, it forms dew on surfaces.
- **Precipitation**: Water droplets in the atmosphere can clump together and fall to the Earth's surface as precipitation, which can include rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

### How Water Moves on Land
- **Runoff**: Water flows over the land's surface and into rivers, which then carry it to larger bodies of water.
- **Infiltration**: Water seeps into the ground, replenishing groundwater reserves.
- **Ice Flow**: Glaciers, massive sheets of ice, slowly move and transport water as they melt.
- **Ocean Circulation**: Winds play a crucial role in driving ocean currents, moving water across the vast expanses of the Earth's oceans.
