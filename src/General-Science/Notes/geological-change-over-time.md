# Geological Change Over Time

## Uniformitarianism
- This principle states that geological processes that occurred in the past can be explained by the same processes that are currently shaping the Earth's surface.

## Fossils
- Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms, providing valuable insights into Earth's history.

### Amber
- Insects can become trapped in sticky tree sap (amber), which hardens over time and preserves the insect as a fossil.

### Asphalt
- Areas with seeping asphalt can trap insects when they become stuck in the sticky pools. Over time, the asphalt hardens, preserving the trapped organisms.

### Rock
- An animal can be rapidly buried under sediments, leading to its decay and eventual incorporation into the rock layers, forming a fossil.

### Frozen
- Organisms can be preserved exceptionally well when they are frozen due to cold temperatures, which slow down the decay process.

### Petrified
- Petrification occurs when an organism's organic tissues are gradually replaced by minerals, resulting in a fossilized representation of the original organism.

## Trace Fossils
- Trace fossils are not the remains of the organism itself but rather fossilized structures that formed in sedimentary rock due to animal activity. They provide clues about ancient behaviors.

### Examples of Trace Fossils
- Footprints: Impressions left by ancient animals as they walked on soft sediment, preserved in rock.
- Scat: Fossilized excrement left behind by animals, offering insights into their diet and existence.
- Burrows: Tubes or tunnels dug by ancient organisms in sediment, providing evidence of their presence and behavior.
