# Erosion and Deposition

## Erosion

Erosion is the natural process responsible for the movement of sediment and various other materials from one location to another. It is a significant geological force that shapes the Earth's surface over time.

### Forms of Erosion

#### Canyons & Valleys
- Occurs when the flow of water through streams and rivers erodes rock from the streambed, gradually forming canyons and valleys.

#### Caves
- Water erodes rock over an extended period, leading to the formation of underground caves.

#### Sea Cliffs
- Coastal waves continuously erode and undercut rock, creating steep slopes or cliffs along the shoreline.

#### Wave Cut Platforms
- Result from the continued erosion of sea cliffs, where the cliffs erode to the extent that they become flat platforms along the coast.

#### Sea Caves
- Develop when the bottom of sea cliffs erodes faster than the top, forming caves that extend into the rock.

#### Sea Arches
- Form when a sea cave erodes all the way through to the other side, resulting in a hole or arch through the rock formation.

#### Sea Stacks
- Occur when a sea arch collapses, leaving behind isolated pillars or stacks of rock in the water.

### Deposition

Deposition is the complementary process to erosion, where eroded materials are deposited or dropped in new locations.

### Forms of Deposition

#### Floodplains
- Occurs when sediment is deposited over land that has been flooded by rivers, creating fertile plains.

#### Deltas
- Streams deposit sediment in a fan-shaped pattern at the mouth of a river, forming a delta.

#### Alluvial Fan
- Characterized by a dry, fan-shaped pattern of sediment deposition, often found at the base of steep mountain slopes.

#### Beaches
- Particles eroded by water or wind can be deposited on a beach, forming sandy shorelines along bodies of water.

## Erosion and Deposition with Wind

- **Abraded Rock**: Wind blowing sand against a surface can wear it down, leading to the development of smooth, polished surfaces.

- **Desert Pavement**: Resulting from the abrading action of wind, desert pavement is a surface layer of closely packed, flat stones.

- **Deflation**: The process by which wind removes loose sediments, leaving larger rocks behind.

- **Dunes**: Wind blows sediment onto small mounds, gradually building up the sediment on these mounds. Different types of dunes can form, depending on wind patterns.

- **Loess**: Fine-grained sediments that can be carried long distances by wind and deposited in various locations.

## Erosion and Deposition with Ice

- **Flowing Ice**: Glacial drift is the sediment left behind by a glacier as it moves. Glaciers can form in mountainous areas (Alpine Glaciers) or spread over large areas (Continental Glaciers).

- **Landforms**: Glacial erosion results in distinctive landforms, including U-shaped valleys, cirques (bowl-shaped depressions), arÃªtes (jagged ridges), horns (pyramid-shaped peaks), and hanging valleys.

## Erosion and Deposition with Gravity

### Slow Mass Movement
- **Creep**: Extremely slow movement of material downslope, often observed in soil and sediment.

### Rapid Mass Movement
- **Rockfall**: Occurs when loose rocks fall down a steep slope due to gravity.

- **Landslide**: A sudden and rapid movement of a large amount of material downslope, often triggered by factors like heavy rainfall or earthquakes.

- **Mudflow**: Happens when a significant amount of water mixes with soil and rock, resulting in slippery mud flowing down a mountainside.
