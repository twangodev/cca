    | Conservative in principles<br/>Disliked democracy and praised the British constitution<br/>Insisted that a balanced government should have aristocracy and monarchy as well as republicanism<br/>Advocated for a strong central government<br/>President holds office for life | Favored republicanism rather than a constitution modeled after the British<br/>Large republic with diverse interests would be best to preserve common good, as they would check each oher<br/>Hoped that the nation’s most learned men rather than local political leaders would govern the national Republic |

2. Determine Central Ideas: What weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation did the Constitutional Convention hope to address?
Articles of Confederation did not let Congress to have power to regulate interstate and international commerce, and the fact that Americans wanted Congress to have the power to set taxes.
3. Draw Conclusions: Consider the men who gathered for the Constitutional Convention. What were the possible strengths and weaknesses of this group?
It was an assembly of demi-gods - mainly people who were involved directly with the revolution. However, they were comprised of all white males, many who were wealthy, and half had slaves, and more than half were lawyers. This can be perceived as a pro or a con because as they are so similar, they would have similar biases.
