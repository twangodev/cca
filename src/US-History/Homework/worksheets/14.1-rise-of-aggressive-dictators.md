# 14.1 Rise of Aggressive Dictators

## Peace Dissolves

1. Identify Cause and Effect: Why didn’t the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations create a “lasting peace”?

   The Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations failed to create lasting peace due to several reasons. The treaty imposed harsh penalties on Germany, leading to resentment and desire for revenge. The League of Nations lacked strong enforcement mechanisms, and the major powers, including the United States, did not join or support it fully.


## Strict Regimes in the Soviet Union and Italy

1. Use Visual Information How did the combination of fear and propaganda help Stalin
   maintain power? Use the image of Stalin in the text to support your answer.

   Stalin used a combination of fear and propaganda to maintain power by portraying himself as a strong and decisive leader. The image of Stalin in the text shows him in a heroic pose, surrounded by symbols of industry and agriculture, implying that he is leading the Soviet Union to prosperity and strength.

2. Draw Conclusions Why did many people support Mussolini’s pledge of order and
   efficiency?

   Many people supported Mussolini's pledge of order and efficiency because Italy was facing economic and social problems, and the government seemed unable to solve them. Mussolini promised to restore order and discipline, which appealed to people's desire for stability and security.


## Germany and Japan Change Leadership

1. Compare and Contrast How were the conditions and sentiments in Germany similar to
   those in Italy in the 1920s?

   Germany and Italy shared similar conditions and sentiments in the 1920s, including economic hardship, political instability, and a sense of humiliation due to the Treaty of Versailles. Both countries experienced the rise of extremist political movements, such as the Nazis and the Fascists, which promised to restore national pride and strength.

2. Analyze Interactions How did the economic problems of the 1930s affect foreign policy?
   Cite evidence from your reading, including actions by Germany, Japan, and other countries
   in Europe.

   The economic problems of the 1930s, such as the Great Depression, led to increased competition and aggression among nations. Germany and Japan sought to expand their territories and resources, which often led to conflicts with other countries. For example, Germany's annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland and Japan's invasion of China and Southeast Asia provoked strong reactions from the international community.


## Dictators Move to Gain Territory

1. Cite Evidence Analyze the “Aggression and Appeasement” chart, which describes how
   the Allies responded to threats from Germany, Japan, and Italy. How does this chart
   support Yeats’s quote: “The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate
   intensity”?

   The "Aggression and Appeasement" chart shows how the Allies responded to threats from Germany, Japan, and Italy. The chart supports Yeats's quote by showing how the major powers, including Britain and France, initially tried to avoid conflict by appeasing the aggressors, hoping that they would be satisfied and stop their expansion. However, this approach failed, and the aggressors continued to pursue their goals with increasing intensity and brutality.

2. Analyze Interactions How did the Spanish Civil War foreshadow the more aggressive
   conflicts in World War II?

   The Spanish Civil War foreshadowed the more aggressive conflicts in World War II by providing a testing ground for new military tactics and weapons, such as the use of air power and armored vehicles. It also showed how different countries and ideologies could get involved in a regional conflict and use it as a proxy war to advance their interests.


## Aggression Meets Appeasement

1. Draw Inferences What effect did the signing of the Munich Pact have on Eastern
   Europeans?

   The signing of the Munich Pact, which allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland, had a negative effect on Eastern Europeans. They saw it as a betrayal by Britain and France, who had promised to protect their security and sovereignty. It also emboldened Hitler to pursue further expansion, leading to the invasion of Czechoslovakia and eventually the outbreak of World War II. Eastern Europeans felt abandoned and vulnerable, and many of them later joined the resistance against the Nazi occupation.
