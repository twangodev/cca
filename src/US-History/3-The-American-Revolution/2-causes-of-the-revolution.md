# Causes of the Revolution

## The Foundations of Colonial Government

American colonists enjoyed British protection during the French and Indian War while paying little of the cost, as well as economic benefits (trade) with the British empire.

When taxes were raised by Parliament, the colonists protested, which became a rebellion, and finally war

Colonists originally believed that Great Britain was the best government (process of common law, trail by jury, freedom of press)

Most importantly, colonists believed that they had no right to pay tax unless it was levied by their representatives (no taxation without representation). Colonial protests in 1760s revealed the differences in Great Britain’s government and colonial governments

### British Government Serves as an Example

British government had 3 branches: Executive (monarch), Legislative (Parliament: House of Lords and House of Commons)

- Aristocrats were in the House of Lords, while people were elected from the House of Commons

Each colony except Pennsylvania had a two house legislature (elected assembly and aristocrats). Colonial governors were appointed and represented the king

- Connecticut and Rhode Island elected their own government, while Pennsylvania’s assembly was elected
- Colonists could not elect members of Parliament

British system was far from democratic compared to today’s standards

Wealthy men controlled the government in the colonies as in Great Britain

### Different Ideas About Representation

Colonial politics differed from the British model in many ways

- Colonists had rights spelled out in a formal documents (Mayflower Compact, etc.), while the British was a collection of laws and traditions
- 2/3 of free colonial men owned enough property to qualify to vote (compared to 1/4 of British men)
- Leaders in colonial government were from wealth, rather than inherited titles as from Britain

Members of Parliament believed they represented the colonists, but colonists saw themselves as equal members in the British political body. England followed a policy of salutary neglect, which allowed colonies to local self-rule. When taxed, this resulted in colonists objecting

## New Taxes Create Conflict

7 Year’s War (French and Indian War) doubled Britain’s national debt and expanded territories.

Parliament needed more money to pay the debt and to protect colonies

British people paid more taxes than colonists did, and because this seemed unfair, Parliament decided the colonists would pay more to help the Empire

### The Sugar, Quartering, and Stamp Acts

Merchants had grown rich from trade (smuggling/bribing through customs)

#### Sugar Act

Lowered the duty on foreign molasses (but enforced customs)

#### Quartering Act

Required the colonies to provide housing and supplies for the British troops stationed there after the French and Indian War

#### Stamp Act

Required colonists to pay a tax on almost all printed materials (newspapers, books, court documents, and land deeds

First time that Parliament had imposed a direct tax within the colonies

### Taxation without Representation

Colonists angrily protested the Stamp Act, as they claimed it threatened their prosperity and liberty

Argued that the colonies had no representation in Parliament, therefore giving Parliament no right to tax them. This puzzled Parliament, as most of the British paid taxes which were not voted in.

Colonist opposition was dismissed as selfish and narrow-minded: the Empire need money and Parliament had the right to place taxes anywhere in the Empire

## Opposition to Taxes Strengthens

Three forms of tax resistance: Intellectual protest, economic boycotts, and violent intimidation forced the British to back down

### Enlightenment Ideas

Colonial protests drew upon liberalism of the Enlightenment, which included Baron de Montesquieu of France and John Locke of England, arguing for natural rights: life, liberty, and property.

#### Patrick Henry

A young Virginia representative who used these ideas to draft a radical document known as the Virginia Resolves, arguing that only colonial assemblies had the right to tax colonists.

The Virginia House of Burgesses accepted most of Henry’s resolves, but rejected two as they were too radical

### Patriot Leaders Emerge

Colonists violently opposed the Stamp Act, as it affected every colonist. The colonists began to work together to fight the tax and became known as the Patriots. To lead protests, associations were formed, such as the Sons of Liberty.

Riots and hatred towards stamp collectors lead to their resignment, leaving no one to collect the taxes
