### Question 6 

The function $f$ has derivatives of all orders for all real numbers. It is known that $f(0) = 2$, $f'(0) = 3$, $f''(x) = -f(x^2)$, and $f'''(x) = -2x \cdot f'(x^2)$

1. Find $f^{(4)}(x)$, the forth derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$. Write the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for $f$ about $x=0$. Show the work that leads to your answer.

    ??? success "Solution"

        Forth derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$:

        $$
        f^{(4)}(x) = -4x^2f''(x^2) - 2f'(x^2)
        $$

        Derivatives of $f^n(x)$ at $x=0$:

        $$
        f(0) = 2, f'(0) = 3, f''(0) = -2, f'''(0) = 0, f^{(4)}(0) = -6
        $$

        Fourth degree Taylor polynomial for $f$ about $x=0$:

        $$
        T_4(x) = 2 + 3x -\frac{2}{2!}x^2 - \frac{6}{4!}x^4\\
        $$

2. The forth-degree Taylor polynomial for $f$ about $x=0$ is used to approximate $f(0.1)$. Given that $|f^{(5)}(x)| \leq 15$ for $0 \leq x \leq 0.5$, use the Lagrange error bound to show that this approximation is within $\frac{1}{10^5}$ of the exact value of $f(0.1)$.

    ??? success "Solution"

        By the Lagrange error bound, the error $|R_n| \leq \frac{f^{(n+1)}(z)|x-a|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$ must be less than $\frac{1}{10^5}$:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \left|\frac{1}{10^5}\right| &\leq \frac{15|0.1-0|^5}{5!}\\
        &\leq \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{10^5}\\
        &\leq \frac{1}{10^5}
        \end{aligned}
        $$

3. Let $g$ be the function such that $g(0)=4$ and $g'(x) = e^xf(x)$. Write the second-degree Taylor polynomial for $g$ about $x=0$.

    ??? success "Solution"

        The second derivative of $g$ with respect to $x$:

        $$
        g''(x) = e^xf'(x) + f(x)e^x
        $$

        Derivatives of $g^n(x)$ at $x=0$:

        $$
        g(0) = 4, g'(0) = 2, g''(0) = 5
        $$

        Second degree Taylor polynomial for $g$ about $x=0$:

        $$
        T_2(x) = 4 + 2x + \frac{5}{2!}x^2
        $$
