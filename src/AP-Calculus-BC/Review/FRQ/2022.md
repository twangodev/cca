### Question 6

The function $f$ is defined by the power series for all real numbers $x$ for which the series converges:

$$f(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^{n}x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} + \dots$$ 

1. Using the ratio test, find the interval of convergence of the power series for $f$. Justify your answer.
2. Show that $\left|f(\frac{1}{2})-\frac{1}{2}\right| \leq \frac{1}{10}$. Justify your answer.
3. Write the first four nonzero terms and the general term for an infinite series that represents $f'(x)$.
4. Use the result from 3. to find the value of $f'(\frac{1}{6})$.
