#  Higher Order Derivatives Using Limits

In class, you have used the limit definition of a derivative to find the derivative of a function. In this quiz, you are going to be using the limit definition to do higher order derivatives instead of using the usual "shortcut" methods.

1. Just as a review, use the limit definition to find the derivative of $f(x) = 2x^2 - x$.
2. Now that you remember the limit definition for $f'(x)$, find a similiar limit definition for $f''(x)$ that does NOT have $f'$ in the answer. That is, your answer should be: $$f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{?}{?}$$
3. Show that your limit definition for $f''(x)$ works for $f(x) = 2x^2 - x$. (Hint: Lots of algebra here)
4. Show that your limit definition works for $f(x) =  a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3$, where $a_n$ is a constant.
5. Now for even higher order derivatives!
    1. Determine the limit definition for $f'''(x)$. (Remember that you should not have any derivatives in your limit definition.)
    2. Determine the limit defintion for $f^{(4)}(x)$. (Hint: Look for patterns)
    3. Determine the limit definition for $f^{(n)}(x)$.
