## Response

1. **Compare** and contrast inbreeding and hybridization.

    Inbreeding and hybridization are two genetic processes used in breeding but with opposite goals. Inbreeding involves mating closely related individuals to preserve desired traits within a lineage, leading to a higher chance of homozygosity and potentially increasing the risk of recessive genetic disorders. Hybridization, on the other hand, involves mating individuals from different lineages or species to produce hybrids, aiming to combine desirable traits from both parents and often resulting in heterozygosity and hybrid vigor (heterosis).

2. **Math Connection:** A breeder performs a test cross to determine the genotype of a black cat. He crosses the black cat (`BB` or `Bb`) with a white cat (`bb`). IF 50 percent of the offspring are black, what is the genotype of the black cat?

    If 50 percent of the offspring are black and 50 percent are white, the genotype of the black cat must be `Bb`. This is because mating a heterozygous black cat (`Bb`) with a homozygous recessive white cat (`bb`) would produce offspring with a 1:1 ratio of black (`Bb`) to white (`bb`) kittens, indicating incomplete dominance where `B` is the dominant allele for black fur and `b` is the recessive allele for white fur.
