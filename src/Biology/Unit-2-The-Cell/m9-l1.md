## Response

1. **Relate** cell sizes to cell functions, and explain why cell size is limited.

    Cell sizes are generally small because a smaller size allows for more efficient nutrient uptake and waste removal, essential for cell function. The size is limited due to the surface area-to-volume ratio, which must be high for efficient exchange of materials.

2. **Describe** the events of each stage of mitosis.

    In mitosis, prophase involves chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown, metaphase aligns chromosomes at the cell's center, anaphase separates chromatids to opposite poles, and telophase reforms the nuclear envelope around the separated chromosomes.

3. **Explain** how the cancer cell cycle is different from a normal cell cycle.

    The cancer cell cycle differs from a normal cell cycle mainly in its regulation; cancer cells often have mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and division, leading to uncontrolled proliferation without the usual checkpoints.

4. **Hypothesize** what might happen if a drug that stopped microtubule movement but did not affect cytokinesis was applied to a cell.

    If a drug stopped microtubule movement but not cytokinesis, the cell would likely fail to properly segregate chromosomes during mitosis, potentially leading to uneven distribution of genetic material and abnormal cell division.

5. **Math Connection** If a plant cell completes the cell cycle in 24 hours, how many cells will be produced in a week?

    If a plant cell completes the cell cycle in 24 hours, it will produce two cells every cycle. Therefore, in a week (168 hours), it would produce $2^{168/24}$ or $2^7$ cells, which equals 128 cells.
