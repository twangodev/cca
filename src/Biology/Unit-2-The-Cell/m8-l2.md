## Response

1. **Explain** why water is essential for the light reactions.

    Water is crucial in the light reactions of photosynthesis because it provides the necessary electrons and protons. When water is split during photolysis, it releases electrons, which are vital for replenishing those lost by chlorophyll in the photosystem II. This process also produces oxygen as a by-product, essential for life on earth. Additionally, the protons released contribute to creating a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, utilized by $ATP$ synthase to generate $ATP$ for the Calvin cycle.

2. **Summarize** the steps in the Calvin cycle.

    The Calvin cycle begins with carbon fixation, where $CO_2$ is attached to ribulose bisphosphate ($RuBP$), forming a six-carbon compound that splits into two three-carbon molecules. These molecules undergo reduction, using $ATP$ and $NADPH$ from light reactions, to produce $G3P$, a precursor for glucose. One $G3P$ molecule exits the cycle per three $CO_2$ molecules fixed, while the rest regenerate $RuBP$, enabling the cycle's continuation.

3. Name the products and reactants of both light-dependent and light-independent reactions, as well as identify the location within the chloroplast where each of the two reactions occur.

    The light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, use water and light to produce oxygen, $ATP$, and $NADPH$. Water provides electrons and protons, while light energy drives the process. In contrast, the Calvin cycle, happening in the chloroplast stroma, utilizes $CO_2$, $ATP$, and $NADPH$ to generate glucose and regenerate $ADP$ and $NADP^+$, continuing the cycle.

4. What are 3 factors that could change the rate of reaction of photosynthesis?

    The rate of photosynthesis is influenced by light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. Increased light intensity enhances photosynthesis to a saturation point. Higher COâ‚‚ levels accelerate the process until reaching an optimum. Temperature affects enzyme activity; thus, photosynthesis rates increase with temperature until a peak, after which they decline due to enzyme denaturation.
