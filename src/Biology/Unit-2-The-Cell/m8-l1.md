## Response

1. **Identify** the major source of energy for living organisms and the main process by which that energy is captured and stored on Earth.

    The primary source of energy for living organisms on Earth is sunlight. This energy is captured and stored through the process of photosynthesis, mainly carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria. In photosynthesis, these organisms convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Glucose is then utilized as a fundamental energy source across various life forms.

2. **Describe** an example of the first law of thermodynamics.

    The first law of thermodynamics, which is the conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only changes form. For example, in an electrical heater, electrical energy is converted into heat energy to warm a room. The total amount of energy remains constant, merely transitioning from one form to another.

3. **Connect** the role of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) to energy transfers within a cell.

    Adenosine Triphosphate ($ATP$) is crucial for energy transfer within cells. It serves as an energy currency, storing and releasing energy as needed for various cellular functions. When $ATP$ is broken down into ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and phosphate, energy is released to fuel activities such as muscle contractions and chemical synthesis. This cycle of $ATP$ breakdown and resynthesis is essential for maintaining cellular energy balance.
