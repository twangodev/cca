# 1: Collecting Data in Reasonable Ways

To begin statistics, you first must ask question about a population, then collect data

## Collecting Data

### Types of Studies

#### Experimental

Experimental studies comprise of experiments. Typical features of an experimental study will comprise of control of different conditions, and typically won’t give *******freedom******* to the participants

#### Observational

Examples of observational studies would be polling, surveying, research, or simulations. Typical features of an observational study will comprise of no control, just *********observing*********, and has a sense of freedom

### Sampling

#### Census

Counts everything, take the U.S. Census for example, which gathers statistics (ideally) for every American. Some cons about this sampling method is that it is too resource intensive ******************************************and not cost effective

#### Samples

Therefore, if a census cannot be done, you want to choose a smaller set, known as a sample. Note that it must be representative.

#### Parameter and Statistics

Population Characteristic (Parameter): The number that represents population (the value of the population).

Statistics: The number that represents the sample

!!! tip
    Parameter requires census, while statistic requires the sample

### Methods for Sampling

#### Simple Random Sample (SRS)

Example: Using a computer as a random number generator, names in a bucket, etc.

Cons: By randomness, you may get similar (homogeneous) people, repeats

!!! warning
    Ensure whether you need to include “without replacement”


#### Stratified Random Sample

Group people/objects into “strata” that are homogeneous, then SRS each group.

#### Cluster Sampling

Group people/objects into clusters that are non-homogeneous (choose a group where people/objects may inherently be different, then SRS the cluster, census people within the cluster

Examples would include classroom or community

#### Convenience Sample

A very easy way to sample, but terrible. Consists of using whatever is the most accessible

#### Systematic Sample

Systematically select people (e.g every 10 people)

Isn’t the most ideal as you could possibility of over-represent people

### Biases

#### Voluntary Response Bias

A type of bias which involves volunteering. The problem with this is is that it will often result with samples dominated by strongly opinionated people

#### Non-response Bias

People who aren’t responding might have an affect

#### Undercoverage Bias (Selection Bias)

The way of choosing people intentionally leaves out people

#### Response Bias (Question Wording)

Twisting the truth, framing the question in such manner so that it may result in bias towards specific response(s)

## Experimental Studies

### Experimental Design

#### Terms

Treatments: Experimental Conditions

Explanatory Variable: Variable that is manipulated

Response Variable: Variable which is affected

Experimental Unit: Person/object receiving treatment

Replication: Many experimental units

Confounding Variable: Things that might affect the result

#### Direct Control

Make variables as much as the same as possible (will consist of variables you can control)

Variables you cannot control would go to random assignment to treatments

#### Methods for Assigning Treatments

Completely Randomized Design: Everything is randomized

Randomized Block Design: Assign treatments to units (random within each block) in each block

!!! tip
    Blocks are groups that or homogeneous, like strata


#### Placebo

Treatment that looks real, but should do nothing. This is often, but not always, a form of control group, and is typically used within medicine

#### Blinding

Single Blind: People do not know which treatment they received

Double Blind: People/person giving treatments do not know

!!! tip
Not all experiments are able to be blind

## Study Conclusions

Experimental Study Conclusion: Cause and Effect relationship, otherwise known as causation

Observational Study Conclusion: Association (correlation)
