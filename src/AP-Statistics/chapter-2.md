# 2: Graphical Methods for Describing Data Distributions

After asking a question and collecting data, the next step would be display and analyze data

## Data Types

### Categorical Data

Data which is in words. Examples would include yes, no, favourite color, etc.

### Numerical Data

Data in numbers

#### Discrete

Only $n$ numbers (countable)

#### Continuous

Any numeric value

## Displaying Data

### Bar Chart

y-axis: frequency or relative frequency (otherwise known as percentage)

The bars are separated and can be in any order

#### Comparative Bar Chart

Features two or more bars stacked beside each other to compare. y-axis will typically be relative frequency as there may be size differences

#### Describing Bar Charts

Which categories are bigger or smaller, and if comparative, what are the difference and similarities between categories

### Numerical Data

#### Dot Plot

Number line with dots (stack dots if more than one occurrence)

#### Histogram

Typically have ranges/relative frequency. Some features of histograms is that precise data is hidden, but it allows for quick summary. The rectangles on the histogram are touching, compared to a bar chart. Additionally, the x-axis is typically continuous numerical, with each bar ranging from $[a,b)$. For situations involving discrete numerical, the label is kept in the center

#### Stem and Leaf

Comprised of a table, with the stem defining each leaf. Typically will have a legend and example, and no commas are used unless there are multi-digits

| Stem | Leaf |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 3 4 |
| 2 | 5 6 7 |

#### Comparative Stem and Leaf

Two stem and leaf charts, with a shared leaf column. The left group will ascend from right to left

| Group A | Stem | Group B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 5 4 | 2 | 1 2 3 |
| 3 2 1 | 3 | 4 5 6 |

#### Cumulative Relative Frequency Plot

Most noticeable features would include only positive slope, as well as the y-axis typically ending at 100% or at any equivalent

#### Time Series Plots

The x-axis is typically time, y-axis is observed value. Features connected line segments

### Describing Distributions

#### Shapes

Unimodal

One center hump, can be referred as approximately symmetric or a bell curve

Left Skew

Most of the data lies on the right

Right Skew

Most of the data lies on the left

Bimodal

Two humps

Multi-modal

Multiple humps

#### SOCS

Shape: Examples would include bell curve, approximately symmetric, skew, bimodal, and multimodal (including outliers)

Outliers: Extreme values

Center: Where most of the data is (in most cases, this would either be median or mean)

Spread: High/Low Spread

### Bivariable Numerical Data

#### Scatter Plots

Select one variable which causes y to change, typically with the $y \text{ vs } x$ format
