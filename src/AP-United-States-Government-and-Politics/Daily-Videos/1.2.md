# Types of Democracy

## Participatory Democracy
- Citizens have the power to influence policy decisions.
- Politicians are responsible for implementing policy decisions.
- Not a direct democracy, but citizens can influence policy.
  
!!! example
    In participatory democracy, citizens have the power to influence policy decisions, though not directly making them. Politicians are responsible for implementing these policy decisions. Notable examples include:
    
    - **Local and State Government**: At these levels, citizens have multiple access points to influence policymakers, fostering a sense of participation.
    
    - **Town Hall Meetings**: Constituents have the opportunity to voice their opinions and discuss upcoming legislation with politicians, promoting active engagement.
    
    - **Initiatives and Referendums**: These mechanisms allow citizens to propose and vote on laws, such as the case of Nevada Background Checks for Gun Purchases in 2016, which required background checks for firearm purchases.


## Pluralist Democracy
- No single group dominates politics.
- Organized groups compete to influence policy.
- Individuals work through common interest groups.

!!! example
    Pluralist democracy thrives on competition among organized groups to influence policy, ensuring no single group dominates politics. Notable examples include:
    
    - **Interest Groups**: Prominent organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the National Organization for Women (NOW) wield significant influence by lobbying, donating, and testifying in Congressional hearings.
    
    - **Common Interest Groups**: Citizens join groups aligned with their concerns, creating a pluralistic landscape of influence.

## Elite Democracy
- A small number of wealthy or well-educated individuals influence politics.
- Participation is limited to highly-informed individuals.
- Advocated by some Framers, like Alexander Hamilton.

!!! example 
    In elite democracy, a select group of wealthy or well-educated individuals holds sway over political decision-making. Examples include:
    
    - **The Electoral College**: In U.S. presidential elections, the Electoral College can determine the outcome, often diverging from the popular vote. This structure places a small group in charge of making crucial political decisions, serving as a check on potential majority tyranny.
