# Checks on the Presidency

## Executive Appointments and Senate Confirmation

- **Role of the Senate**: Provides "advice and consent" on presidential appointments, including Cabinet members, ambassadors, and White House staff.
- **Cabinet Members**: Serve as top advisors and manage departments/agencies. Their confirmations can be contentious due to ideological differences or controversial backgrounds.
- **Ambassadors**: Handle diplomatic relations and can face opposition if perceived as politically biased.
- **White House Staff**: Generally less controversial but can still face opposition based on qualifications or ideological differences.
- **Conflict Potential**: Varies based on nominee's background and the political climate. Aim is for effective and timely appointments.

## President’s Legacy: The Judicial Department

- **Senate Confirmation Process**: Critical check on presidential power, ensuring nominees are qualified and align with Senate's views.
- **Judicial Appointments**: Presidents make lifetime appointments to the judiciary, significantly impacting the country's direction even after their term.
- **Legacy Impact**: Judicial appointments shape the federal judiciary's ideology and legal precedents for decades.

## Illustrative Examples

- **Conflicts Abroad**: Vietnam, Iraq, Kosovo, Libya, Syria show challenges in aligning presidential and Senate views on military action.
- **No Child Left Behind Act (2001)**: Demonstrates presidential power to push significant legislative initiatives despite Senate opposition.
- **Significant Appointments**:
    - Sandra Day O’Connor and Thurgood Marshall's appointments to the Supreme Court by President Reagan highlighted the president's influence on the judiciary.
- **Failed Appointments**: Robert Bork, John Tower, and Abe Fortas are examples of nominations defeated by the Senate, illustrating the Senate's critical advisory role.
