# 4 - How and Why Political Parties Change

## Candidate-Centered Campaigns
Since the 1960s, political parties' roles in campaigns have shifted with advancements in media technology. Television's widespread adoption allowed candidates to communicate directly with voters, a trend that has only expanded with the rise of the internet and social media. This shift has diminished the influence of political parties, as candidates now focus more on personal image and qualifications rather than party platforms.

### Focus
Campaigns are increasingly candidate-centered, emphasizing individual attributes over party ideologies. This change has led to a reduction in party influence, as voters pay more attention to the candidates themselves.

### Voter Engagement
These campaigns enhance voter engagement by establishing personal connections with the candidate, thereby increasing participation and attention in elections. They also empower voters by allowing them to make choices based on personal attributes rather than party affiliation.

### Candidate Diversity
Candidate-centered campaigns promote diversity in political representation by focusing on individual backgrounds and experiences. This approach has helped break down traditional barriers, offering voters a broader spectrum of choices.

## Appealing to Demographic Coalitions
Political parties aim to broaden their appeal by integrating various demographic groups while maintaining core supporters. Inclusivity in party platforms and diverse representation at national conventions are strategies to attract a wide array of voters.

## Changes in Party Structures
Changes in party structures are influenced by critical elections, regional alignments, and advancements in communication and data management technologies.

### Critical Elections and Regional Alignments
Historical shifts in voter alignment, such as those during the 1932 election, have prompted parties to redefine their coalitions. Modern trends show increased voter independence and party realignment, especially evident in the current era of divided government.

### Campaign Finance Law
Regulations on campaign financing have reshaped party dynamics by imposing contribution limits and enhancing transparency, which has affected parties' roles in elections and their interactions with special interest groups.

### Communication & Data Management
The advent of digital technology has transformed how parties communicate with voters. Targeted advertising, social media engagement, email marketing, and sophisticated data management systems are now integral to campaign strategies.
