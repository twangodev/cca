# 7 - Groups Influencing Policy Outcomes

## Political Actors & Influencing Public Policy

### Single-issue groups
Single-issue groups concentrate on specific areas, utilizing resources to influence policy directly related to their interests. Prominent examples include:

- **National Rifle Association (NRA):** Focuses on gun rights, using membership strength and financial resources for lobbying and political campaigns.
- **American Association of Retired Persons (AARP):** Holds significant influence due to its large, active voting demographic.

### Ideological/Social Movements
Historical movements have spurred significant policy changes:

- **Civil Rights Movement:** Led by groups like NAACP, CORE, SCLC, and SNCC, resulting in groundbreaking legislation for racial equality.
- **Women's Rights:** Gained momentum in the 1960s, with groups like NOW and NARAL influencing major legislative changes such as Title IX.
- **Environmental Rights:** Growth in groups like the Sierra Club and Audubon Society in the 1960s prompted significant environmental legislation and the creation of the EPA.
- **Consumer Rights:** Advocacy by figures like Ralph Nader in the 1960s highlighted safety concerns in the auto industry, influencing regulations and the establishment of agencies like the CFPB in 2011.

### Protest Movements
Protests play a crucial role in policy change by raising awareness, mobilizing support, and pressuring policymakers, often in conjunction with larger civil and social movements.

## Scope of Influence

### Stage 1: Agenda-setting

### Stage 4: Implementation
- Military and bureaucratic agencies play key roles, particularly in defense and policy enforcement.

### Stage 5: Evaluation

## Policy Shifts
Elections and policy changes can lead to political realignments:

- **1930s New Deal:** Shifted many voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party.

These dynamics highlight the evolving influence of various groups on public policy across different eras and political contexts.
