# 2:  Structures, Powers, and Functions of Congress

## The House of Representatives

- **Purpose:** Represents the population's changing needs and opinions with a larger membership based on population.
- **Elections:** Members face re-election every two years, encouraging responsiveness to public priorities.
- **Powers:** Initiates tax laws and spending bills, overseeing taxing and spending legislation.

## The Senate

- **Representation:** Represents states equally, acting as a check on the House's more populist tendencies.
- **Powers:** Confirms presidential appointments, ratifies treaties, tries impeachment cases, and amends revenue bills.

## Shared Powers of Congress

Congress holds powers essential for governance, including:

- Enforcing taxes and borrowing money.
- Regulating commerce and raising an army.
- Establishing naturalization laws, post offices, and federal courts.
- Providing for a militia and making laws deemed necessary and proper.

Additionally, Congress can influence executive actions through the power of the purse, promoting specific programs or limiting agency power.

## Committees and Their Roles

Committees in both chambers play a critical role in refining legislation, conducting hearings, and facilitating debate. Their functions reflect the distinct constitutional responsibilities of each chamber:

- **House Committees:** Focus on reviewing legislation and setting chamber priorities.
- **Senate Committees:** Take a longer-term policy view and focus on consensus-building due to the chamber's unique roles in appointments, treaties, and impeachment trials.

## Oversight and Transparency

Congressional oversight, conducted through committees, checks the executive branch, investigating corruption and inefficiencies. Public hearings and debates increase government transparency and inform society about pressing issues.

## Legislative Process

The legislative process is deliberately slow, encouraging compromise and thorough consideration of bills. This process involves:

- Bill introduction by Congress members.
- Committee review and refinement.
- Debate and voting, differing between the House and Senate due to their sizes.

## Rules and Structure

- **House Rules:** Governed by the Rules Committee, which decides on debate lengths and amendment rules.
- **Senate Rules:** Fewer due to its smaller size, allowing extended debates and practices like filibustering.

## Important Roles

- **House:** The Speaker plays a key role in legislative proceedings, along with party leaders and whips.
- **Senate:** The Vice President, as President of the Senate, and the Majority Leader, guide the chamber's proceedings.

## The President's Desk

Upon receiving a bill, the President can sign it into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without a signature. Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in both houses.
