# 9 - Amendments: Due Process and the Right to Privacy

## Introduction to Due Process and Privacy
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ensures protection against deprivation of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures. This concept has been extended to safeguard individual rights within the criminal justice system and against unwarranted government intrusions into personal privacy.

## Procedural Due Process
Procedural Due Process, rooted in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, mandates the government to follow fair procedures when affecting a person's life, liberty, or property. Key requirements include:
- Notice of charges
- Opportunity to be heard and defend oneself
- Impartial and evidence-based government actions
- Right to a fair hearing by an independent decision-maker

## Incorporation of the Bill of Rights
"Incorporation" refers to applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, ensuring federal and state governments equally respect individual rights. This process has significantly impacted the protection of freedoms at all government levels.

## Substantive Due Process
Substantive Due Process protects fundamental rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but deemed essential for liberty and happiness. It supports rights like privacy, marriage, procreation, and parental rights, allowing the Supreme Court to nullify laws infringing on these essential freedoms.
