# Challenges of the Articles of Confederation

The Articles of Confederation were the first constitution of the United States, written during the American Revolution and adopted in 1777. They established a federal government with limited powers and a loose confederation of independent states. The central government under the Articles faced significant limitations:

### Key Weaknesses

- **Limited Powers of the Central Government**: Struggled to enforce laws and regulate commerce.
- **No Taxation Powers**: Could not raise revenue through taxation.
- **No Control Over Commerce**: Faced challenges in regulating trade and commerce between states.
- **Absence of Executive or Judicial Branches**: Lacked a strong executive or judicial branch to enforce laws and interpret the Constitution.
- **Unanimity Requirement for Amendments**: Changes to the Constitution required agreement from all states.

These issues led to the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, establishing a stronger central government.

### Weak Central Government

A weak central government has limited powers and struggles to govern effectively. The government under the Articles was considered weak due to its limited ability to enforce laws, regulate commerce, and raise revenue, leading to economic instability and disputes between states.

### No Taxation Powers

The federal government's lack of taxation powers under the Articles meant it couldn't collect taxes to support its activities or pay off national debts. This limitation was a key factor in the failure of the Articles.

### No Control Over Commerce

The inability to regulate trade effectively under the Articles resulted in economic instability and disputes. States had their own trade policies, complicating interstate and international commerce.

### No Executive or Judicial Branches

The absence of separate executive and judicial branches under the Articles led to difficulties in law enforcement and government accountability.

### Requirement of Unanimity for Changes

The rule requiring unanimity among states to amend the Articles made it challenging to address new issues and adapt to changing circumstances.

## Shays' Rebellion

Shays' Rebellion, occurring in Massachusetts in 1786-87, exemplified the weaknesses of the central government under the Articles. Led by Daniel Shays, it was a response to economic hardship and political instability. The rebellion highlighted the need for a stronger central government, contributing to the creation of the United States Constitution in 1787.

### Example of Shays' Rebellion

The Massachusetts government's struggle to quell the rebellion due to the limitations of the central government under the Articles led to calls for a more effective government. The rebellion influenced the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where the United States Constitution was drafted to address the challenges of the Articles, establishing a stronger, more responsive government.
