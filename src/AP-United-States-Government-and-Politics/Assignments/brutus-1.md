# Brutus 1

- Why does Brutus I concede that the country faces problems under the Articles of Confederation?

    Brutus I concedes that the country faces problems under the Articles of Confederation, primarily due to the weak central government which lacked the power to enforce laws, regulate commerce, or effectively manage foreign relations. This weakness hindered the nation's ability to operate efficiently and cohesively.

- Why does the author of Brutus I believe the decision to ratify the Constitution is "the most important question that was ever proposed..?"

    The author believes the decision to ratify the Constitution is "the most important question ever proposed" because it involves establishing a new, strong central government, fundamentally changing the nature of American governance and potentially impacting the rights and liberties of the people.

- According to Brutus I why should citizens think twice before they voluntarily increase the government's power?

    Brutus I advises caution in increasing government power because history shows that people surrender their freedoms incrementally, often under the guise of temporary measures during crises, but these powers tend to become permanent, thus eroding civil liberties.

- Why does Brutus I emphasize that the Constitution creates a federal government, abolishing the confederation?

    Brutus I emphasizes that the Constitution creates a federal government, effectively abolishing the confederation, because he fears this new powerful central government will dominate the states, rendering them mere administrative units rather than sovereign entities.

- How will the necessary and proper clause result in uncontrolled power in Congress? How does the supremacy clause nullify the power of the states?

    The Necessary and Proper Clause could result in uncontrolled power in Congress by allowing it to pass laws it deems necessary, extending beyond enumerated powers. The Supremacy Clause nullifies state power by asserting that federal laws take precedence over state laws, potentially leading to federal overreach.

- Do you agree that the power to lay and collect taxes is the most important power granted to the federal government? How does the federal government's power of taxation limit the state's ability to raise money to support  their governments?

    This power is considered the most important because it enables the federal government to secure resources independently, potentially at the expense of state governments' ability to raise revenue. States may find their fiscal capabilities diminished if federal taxation exhausts the citizens' capacity to pay.

- What evidence dies Brutus I use to support the argument that the federal courts will "swallow up" all of the powers of the state courts?

    Brutus I argues that the federal courts will "swallow up" state courts' powers because the Constitution allows federal courts to overrule state court decisions. He fears that the extensive jurisdiction of federal courts will diminish the role and authority of state courts.

- Which enumerated powers of Congress are likely to lead to uncontrollable power? Under what circumstances is Congress likely to take power away from the states?

    Powers like regulating commerce, raising and maintaining armies, and enacting laws necessary for executing various powers could lead to uncontrollable federal power. Congress might take power from states under circumstances involving national security, economic crises, or interstate issues.

- On what point do both the Federalists and the Antifederalists agree? Do you agree that a large republic with many diverse views makes it difficult to make decisions for the public good? What historical examples does Brutus I use to support the argument that democracy cannot survive in large republics?

    Both groups agree on the need for a union but differ on the nature and extent of central power. Brutus I suggests that a large republic with diverse views makes decision-making complex and potentially unrepresentative of the public good. He cites historical examples like the Greek city-states to argue that democracies thrive in smaller, more homogeneous societies.

- Why does pure democracy function best in small territories? Why is it difficult for members for members of the legislature to represent their constituents wishes in a large territory?

    Pure democracy is more effective in small territories because it allows for direct participation and better representation of citizens' interests. In large territories, legislators may become disconnected from their constituents, leading to misrepresentation.

- In what ways was the large republic of the United States diverse, and how does this diversity hinder the operation of the government?

    The diversity in the large U.S. republic includes varying economic interests, cultural backgrounds, and political beliefs, which can hinder cohesive governance and create conflicts of interest, making it challenging to enact laws that satisfy all parties.

- What 3 reasons does Brutus I give to explain why it will be difficult to carry out laws in a large republic?

    Brutus I cites three reasons: the diversity of the people making uniform laws impractical, the vast territory making enforcement challenging, and the potential for a disconnect between the rulers and the ruled, leading to misunderstanding and mistrust of laws.

- Why does a standing army cause citizens to support the government out of fear, instead of confidence and respect? Brutus I argues that citizens will not be acquainted with their rules in a large republic. How might this lead to fear and suspicion of government, and even the possibility of military rule?

    A standing army might cause citizens to fear their government, as it could be used to enforce laws with force rather than consent. In a large republic, citizens not acquainted with their leaders might fear and suspect them, potentially leading to authoritarian or military rule.

- How does Brutus I conclude the argument that the Constitution should not be ratified?

    Brutus I concludes that the Constitution should not be ratified because it establishes a powerful central government that threatens state sovereignty and individual liberties. He advocates for a confederation of small, autonomous republics that better preserve freedom and democracy.
