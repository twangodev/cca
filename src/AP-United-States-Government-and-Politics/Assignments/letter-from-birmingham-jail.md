## Response

1. Analyzing the cause of injustice is crucial because it allows for addressing the root problems that lead to systemic issues, rather than merely treating the symptoms. By understanding and tackling the causes, long-term and meaningful change can be achieved, preventing the recurrence of similar injustices.
2. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was inspired by the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. Gandhi's success in using nonviolent protest to achieve political and social change showed King the power and moral authority of nonviolent activism.
3. Modern-day movements such as Black Lives Matter, climate change activism like the efforts of Extinction Rebellion, and the MeToo movement use public demonstrations, social media campaigns, and direct action to create social tension. This tension is intended to raise awareness, challenge complacency, and force conversations and actions on systemic injustices.
4. "In monologue rather than dialogue" refers to a one-sided conversation where one party speaks without listening to or engaging with the other. King considered this a tactic used by oppressors to avoid genuine engagement and change. He advocated for dialogue as a way to understand different perspectives and work towards solutions.
5. The morality of groups versus individuals can depend on the context. Groups can amplify moral and immoral behavior through collective action and peer influence. However, both groups and individuals are capable of moral and immoral actions. The key is the values and objectives that guide them, as well as the mechanisms for accountability and reflection.
6. Dr. King invokes the principle of equality and the unalienable rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." He highlights the contradiction between these promised rights and the reality of racial injustice and segregation, urging America to live up to its foundational ideals.
7. Reaching a consensus about just or unjust laws is difficult due to varying moral, cultural, and personal beliefs. People's interpretations of justice are influenced by their experiences, values, and the societal context, leading to disagreements on what constitutes fairness and equity.
8. Dr. King referred to "a negative peace" as a superficial absence of tension or conflict, without the presence of justice. He critiqued this form of peace for being more about maintaining the status quo and less about addressing underlying injustices.
9. Dr. King believed that nonviolence was crucial not only for moral reasons but also for practical and strategic ones. It prevented the escalation of violence, won the sympathy of moderate observers, and highlighted the stark moral contrast between the peaceful protesters and the violent responses of segregationists.
10. Dr. King aligned himself with what he called "religious extremists" to reframe the negative connotation of extremism and to show that being extreme in the pursuit of justice and love, as exemplified by Jesus Christ and other religious figures, was noble and necessary for profound social change.
11. An optimistic outlook and connection with American political values like freedom, equality, and democracy served to align the civil rights movement with the foundational principles of the United States. This framing helped to mobilize support among Americans who valued these ideals, making the movement's goals resonate more broadly.
12. The civil rights movement and nonviolent protesters drew directly on the values of liberty, equality, and the pursuit of happiness as outlined in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. They argued that segregation and racial discrimination were fundamentally at odds with these American ideals, using the nation's founding documents to legitimize their struggle for rights and equality.
