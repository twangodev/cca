### Questions
- What is a declaration?

    A declaration is a formal statement, announcement, or proclamation. In the context of the Declaration of Independence, it was a document that officially announced the American colonies' separation from British rule and their intention to form an independent nation.

- Why did Jefferson include a list of grievances?

    Jefferson included a list of grievances in the Declaration to justify the colonies' decision to seek independence. These grievances detailed the ways in which King George III had violated the colonies' rights and failed to protect their interests. By listing these grievances, Jefferson aimed to make a compelling case for independence both to the colonists and to the international community.

- Why does Jefferson conclude with a statement on separation of powers?

    The conclusion of the Declaration of Independence doesn't explicitly discuss the separation of powers, which is more a feature of the U.S. Constitution. However, the Declaration does conclude with a statement affirming the colonies' status as free and independent states. This reflects the Enlightenment idea that a government's legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed, a principle that later influenced the structure of the U.S. government under the Constitution.


### Check for Understanding
- Explain why the writers of the Declaration of Independence Felt the need to declare their reasons for separating from the British?

    The writers felt the need to declare their reasons for separation to explain and justify their actions. By outlining their grievances and principles, they sought to legitimize their rebellion and gain support both domestically and internationally.

- Describe what Jefferson meant in his statement: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal..."

    Jefferson's statement reflects Enlightenment ideals emphasizing that every individual inherently possesses the same basic rights and freedoms, regardless of their status at birth. This was a radical notion at the time, contrasting with the class-based hierarchies prevalent in Europe.

- Describe three complaints of the colonists against the king.

    - Imposing taxes without consent: Colonists were frustrated with taxation without representation in the British Parliament.
    - Dissolving representative houses: The king repeatedly dissolved colonial legislatures that opposed his policies.
    - Maintaining standing armies in peacetime: The king kept armies in the colonies during peacetime without the consent of the legislatures.

- Explain why The signers of the Declaration of Independence pledged "To each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor."

    The signers understood the grave risks of declaring independence, including potential treason charges. Their pledge symbolized their deep commitment to the cause and their willingness to sacrifice everything for the birth of a new nation.

### Critical Thinking
- After winning independence The British, the founders created a new government under the Articles of Confederation And then the Constitution. Explain how the constitution reflects the declarations assertation that the government " derives it's power from the consent of the governed."

    The U.S. Constitution establishes a government based on democratic principles, where power is vested in the people. It ensures representation through elected officials and incorporates checks and balances, allowing for a government that is responsive to the will of the citizens, thus reflecting the Declaration's assertion.
