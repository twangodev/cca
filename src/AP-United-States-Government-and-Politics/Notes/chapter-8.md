# 8 - Civil Liberties: Protecting Fundamental Freedoms

## The Constitution and the Bill of Rights

- The notion of incorporating a list of individual rights protections within a constitution wasn't unique to the year 1787.
- Following American independence, state governments began including protections for individual rights in their constitutions, although these protections varied significantly.
- Some fundamental rights, such as freedom of the press or religion, were often missing, and persecution of religious minorities and religious qualifications for office were common.

### U.S. Constitution's Protections

- The U.S. Constitution, aware of the necessity to safeguard individual rights, included specific protections:
    - A strict definition of treason to protect the right to criticize the government, mirroring First Amendment speech protections.
    - Protections for habeas corpus rights, jury trial rights, and religious freedom across various articles.
- Despite these protections, the original document lacked a comprehensive bill of rights.

#### Bill of Rights Definition

A list of fundamental rights and freedoms that individuals possess. The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution constitute the Bill of Rights.

### Debate and the Lack of a Bill of Rights

- The Constitutional Convention debated including a bill of rights but ultimately rejected proposals for its inclusion.
- The absence of a comprehensive list of individual rights became a significant point of contention, especially among the Antifederalists.

### Federalists vs. Antifederalists

#### Antifederalist Concerns

- The Antifederalists criticized the Constitution's lack of a bill of rights, fearing it signaled the growth of centralized power.
- They advocated for more protections for state rights and individual freedoms.

#### Federalist Response

- Hamilton, in Federalist No. 84, argued against a bill of rights, suggesting it was unnecessary and potentially dangerous, as it might imply that unlisted rights were not protected.

### Ratification and the Promise of Amendments

- To quell concerns, promises of amendments were made during state ratification debates.
- James Madison introduced proposed amendments in Congress, leading to the ratification of the first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, on December 15, 1791.

### The First Ten Amendments: Overview

- The amendments cover a wide range of protections, from freedom of speech and religion to rights concerning the judicial system and federalism.
- The Ninth Amendment addresses Hamilton's concern by asserting that the list of rights in the Constitution is not exhaustive.

## Selective Incorporation 

### Introduction to Selective Incorporation

- Selective incorporation involves extending the protections of the Bill of Rights to state laws and actions through the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.
- This process has gradually applied almost all the rights contained in the Bill of Rights to the states, ensuring fundamental liberties are protected at all levels of government.

### Historical Context and Early Challenges

#### The Case of Benjamin Gitlow

- Gitlow was arrested in 1919 under the New York State Criminal Anarchy Act for advocating the overthrow of the government through his publication, "The Revolutionary Age."
- His conviction led to a significant Supreme Court case, Gitlow v. New York (1925), where he argued the law violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process.

#### Supreme Court's Decision in Gitlow v. New York

- The Court held that certain restrictions on speech could be legitimate if they posed a sufficient threat to public welfare or safety.
- This decision marked the beginning of the doctrine of selective incorporation, applying the First Amendment's protections to the states.

### The Fourteenth Amendment and Due Process Clause

A clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that prevents state governments from depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property without legal safeguards.

### Selective Incorporation Over Time

- The Supreme Court has used the due process clause to incorporate most of the Bill of Rights' protections against state actions.
- Notable cases include Gitlow v. New York for freedom of speech and McDonald v. Chicago for the right to bear arms.

#### Selective Incorporation Definition

The piecemeal process by which the Supreme Court has affirmed that almost all of the protections within the Bill of Rights also apply to state governments.

### Key Supreme Court Decisions on Incorporation

- The table in the notes lists significant Supreme Court decisions related to selective incorporation, including rights ranging from freedom of speech to the right to a fair trial.
- Not all rights have been incorporated; for example, the right to an indictment by a grand jury and the right to a jury trial in civil cases remain exceptions.

### Implications of Selective Incorporation

- Selective incorporation ensures that states cannot infringe upon fundamental freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights.
- This doctrine has significantly expanded the scope of civil liberties in the United States, making the protections of the Bill of Rights applicable at both federal and state levels.

Selective incorporation underscores the evolving understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in safeguarding individual freedoms against overreach by state governments, reinforcing the principle that certain rights are so fundamental that they must be protected across all layers of governance.

## The Right of Religious Freedom

- The First Amendment safeguards religious freedom through two clauses: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause.

#### Establishment Clause

- Prevents the government from requiring citizens to join or support a religion.
- Forbids the state from declaring an official religion.

#### Free Exercise Clause

- Protects individuals' rights to practice and express their religious beliefs.
- Allows for religious expressions at home, provided they don't infringe on others' rights.

### Complexities in Applying Religious Freedoms

- Cases often present conflicts between the establishment and free exercise clauses, requiring careful interpretation by the Supreme Court.
- Historical context shows a deep-rooted wariness about governmental power over religious practice, leading to the principle of separation between church and state.

### Supreme Court and the Establishment Clause

#### Taxpayer Funds and Private Religious Schools

- In *Board of Education v. Allen* (1968), the Court ruled some forms of taxpayer support for private religious schools permissible.

#### Prayer in Public Schools

- Cases like *Engel v. Vitale* (1962) and *Abington School District v. Schempp* (1963) ruled school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings unconstitutional.

#### Current Guidelines

- Students may pray during noninstructional time, participate in religious groups, and express religious beliefs in assignments, following specific guidelines.

#### Lemon Test

- Established in *Lemon v. Kurtzman* (1971) for permissible government involvement in religion, requiring a secular purpose, not advancing/inhibiting religion, and avoiding excessive government-religion entanglement.

### Free Exercise and the Supreme Court

#### Wisconsin v. Yoder

- Ruled that compulsory school attendance law violated the Amish community's free exercise rights by infringing on their religious beliefs and way of life.

#### Employment Division v. Smith

- Introduced a neutrality test for conflicts between religious expression and state action, ruling state laws as religiously neutral if they don't target a specific religion and serve a compelling state interest.
