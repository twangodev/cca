    - Establishing the Office of Homeland Security.

### The Capture of Yaser Hamdi

- **Legal Battle**: Hamdi's detention without legal representation or court challenge led to his father filing a habeas corpus petition, arguing constitutional rights violations.

### Presidential Actions in the War on Terror

- **Case of Anwar al-Awlaki**:
    - American citizen targeted and killed in Yemen by drone strikes.

- **Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)**:
    - Legal framework used to justify military actions against terrorists.
    - Critics argue it provides too much power to the president without sufficient congressional oversight.

### Key Points

- **Presidential Power Expansion**: Post-9/11 actions reflect a significant expansion of executive power in the context of national security.
- **Legal and Ethical Controversies**: The use of drone strikes, especially against American citizens, and the detention of suspects without trial, have sparked significant debate.

- **Debate on Presidential Selection**: Concerns among less populous states about being overshadowed by more populous states led to the establishment of the Electoral College system for presidential elections.

### Presidential Powers and Roles

## Limits on Presidential Power

### Constitutional Checks and Balances

- **Division of Powers**: Specific powers granted to Congress and the judiciary serve as checks on presidential authority.
- **Congressional Authority**: Essential for passing laws, funding programs, and approving presidential appointments and treaties.
- **Judicial Review**: The Supreme Court can overturn presidential actions that violate the Constitution.

### Key Congressional Powers

- **Legislative Powers**: Congress holds the power to investigate, impeach, pass budgets, and override presidential vetoes.

- **Purpose**: Addresses "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors," distinct from criminal proceedings.

### Judicial Checks

- **Supreme Court Authority**: Can challenge and overturn executive actions, including executive orders and claims of executive privilege.
- **Notable Cases**:
    - **United States v. Nixon (1974)**: Affirmed executive privilege but required Nixon to release Watergate-related recordings.
    - **Executive Order Challenges**: Recent challenges to executive orders on immigration and national security have reached the Supreme Court, resulting in mixed outcomes.

### Implications and Considerations

- **Balance of Power**: These mechanisms ensure a balance between the branches, preventing excessive concentration of power in the executive.
- **Presidential Constraints**: Despite significant authority, the president operates within a framework that requires collaboration, negotiation, and adherence to legal and constitutional standards.

## The Modern Presidency in Context

### The Vice Presidency

- **Constitutional Basis**: Initially weak, with the Vice President serving as the runner-up in presidential elections until the Twelfth Amendment refined the selection process.
- **Roles**: Presides over the Senate (rarely in practice) and succeeds the president if necessary. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarifies succession and temporary incapacitation procedures.

### The First Spouse

- **Informal Role**: Acts as an advisor and public figure without a formal government position, often focusing on specific social or policy issues.

### Executive Office of the President (EOP)

- **Expansion**: Grew significantly to support the presidency, especially under Franklin D. Roosevelt, marking the shift to the modern presidency.
- **Key Components**: Includes the Office of Management and Budget, National Security Council, and Council of Economic Advisors, among others, serving as the president's primary source of advice and policy management.

### Partisan Politics and Congress

- **Chief of Party Role**: Presidents serve as de facto leaders of their parties, influencing party strategies and legislative agendas.
- **Negotiations and Bargaining**: Presidents must navigate partisan dynamics in Congress, using persuasion and negotiation to advance their agendas, especially during periods of divided government.

### Public Opinion and Communication

- **Bully Pulpit and Going Public**: Presidents use their visibility and media access to directly appeal to the public, influencing policy debates and legislative priorities.
- **Impact of Public Opinion**: Public approval ratings can significantly enhance or limit a president's effectiveness and leverage in political negotiations.

### Presidential Approval Ratings

- **Significance**: Reflects public support and can impact a president's ability to govern effectively.
- **Factors Affecting Approval**: Include handling of crises, economic performance, and major legislative achievements. Approval typically fluctuates, with potential spikes during national crises or declines due to policy failures or scandals.

### DACA and Immigration Policy

- **Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)**: An executive order by President Obama aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.
- **Partisan Responses**: Garnered support and criticism along party lines, highlighting the challenges of immigration reform and executive action in a divided political environment.
- **Legal and Political Challenges**: Faced opposition and legal challenges, with its future often uncertain, demonstrating the contentious nature of executive orders and the complex interplay between the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary in policy implementation.

## The War on Terror and Presidential Power

### Supreme Court Restrictions on Presidential Power

- **Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2002)**: The Supreme Court challenged the notion of unchecked presidential authority during wartime, affirming that war does not grant the president a "blank check" regarding the rights of citizens. Yaser Hamdi, an American citizen detained in Guantanamo Bay, was entitled to a hearing before a neutral decision maker, emphasizing the importance of constitutional rights even in times of national security concerns.

### The Paradox of Power

- **Presidential Actions**: The ability to act decisively in crisis situations is a unique presidential tool, highlighted during the War on Terror. Yet, this power comes with constitutional limitations and ethical debates, especially regarding the treatment of American citizens accused of terrorism.
- **Anwar al-Awlaki Case**: Illustrates the complexities of presidential decision-making in the War on Terror. The targeted drone strike against al-Awlaki, an American citizen, by President Obama's administration raised questions about the extent of executive power in targeting citizens without trial.
- **Historical Context**: The use of drone strikes to eliminate suspected terrorists, including American citizens, has been part of the U.S. strategy in combating terrorism. These actions underscore the tension between national security imperatives and constitutional protections.

### Reflections on Presidential Power

- **Constitutional Provisions and Challenges**: The framers designed the presidency to be strong and decisive, yet constrained by checks and balances to prevent the emergence of an elected monarchy.
- **Public Expectations vs. Constitutional Limits**: Americans expect their presidents to lead effectively, particularly in times of crisis, while adhering to the constitutional framework and respecting civil liberties.
- **Partisan Politics and Leadership**: The presidency is inherently political, situated within a system designed to balance power among branches of government. Yet, there is a public expectation for the president to rise above partisan politics and unite the nation, especially during crises.

### Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Rights of Citizens Accused of Terrorism**: The debate over how to balance national security interests with the constitutional rights of citizens accused of terrorism continues to be a contentious issue, reflecting broader concerns about executive power, due process, and civil liberties.
- **Presidential Authority in National Security**: The War on Terror has tested the limits of presidential power, challenging the legal and ethical boundaries of executive actions in the name of national security.
