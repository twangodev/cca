# 4 - Congress: Representation, Organization, and Legislation


## The Constitution and Congress

### Article I: Congress

- Article I of the Constitution focuses on Congress, offering a detailed outline of its structure and powers, more so than for the executive and judicial branches.

### Key Differences between the Chambers

#### Creation of a Bicameral Legislature

- The Constitutional Convention's compromise between populous and less populous states led to a bicameral legislature: the House of Representatives and the Senate.
- This structure was designed to implement checks and balances within Congress and ensure diverse representation.

#### Roles and Functions

- **House of Representatives**: Directly elected, serving two-year terms to remain close to the electorate.
- **Senate**: Offers stability with six-year terms, with elections staggered every two years to ensure continuity.

#### Checks and Balances

- The bicameral legislature was proposed to double the security to the people, requiring concurrence from two distinct bodies to prevent usurpation and perfidy.

### The House of Representatives

- **Election and Term**: Direct election by voters, serving two-year terms.
- **Qualifications**: Minimum age of 25, seven years of citizenship, and residency in the state they represent.
- **Intended Role**: Designed to be closely aligned with the electorate's wishes.

### The Senate

- **Election and Term**: Initially elected by state legislatures, now directly elected due to the 17th Amendment, serving six-year terms.
- **Qualifications**: Minimum age of 30, nine years of citizenship, and residency in the state they represent.
- **Intended Role**: Acts as a stabilizing factor, more insulated from public opinion and temporary passions.

### Powers of Congress

#### Legislative Authority

- Congress holds the primary authority to pass laws on national policy, with enumerated powers in areas like economic policy, national security, and foreign policy.

#### The Budgeting Process

- Congress is responsible for setting the federal budget, significantly influencing policy through the allocation of funds.

#### Oversight

- Oversight ensures that executive agencies and officials act in accordance with congressional goals and legal standards.

### Checks and Balances

- Congress plays a crucial role in the system of checks and balances, with powers to declare war, ratify treaties, confirm judicial and executive nominations, and impeach federal officials.

## Politics of Congressional Elections

### Constituency and Apportionment

#### Constituency Definition

- **Constituency**: A body of voters in a given area who elect a representative or senator.

#### Senate Representation

- The Senate has 100 members, two from each state, representing states rather than population sizes, leading to unequal voter representation between large and small states.

#### House of Representatives Apportionment

- **Apportionment**: Determining the number of representatives each state has in the House based on census data. The House has been fixed at 435 members since 1929, with each state guaranteed at least one representative.

### Redistricting and Gerrymandering

#### Redistricting

- **Redistricting**: The process of redrawing electoral district boundaries after each census. It can significantly affect the political composition of constituencies.

#### Gerrymandering

- **Gerrymandering**: Manipulating district boundaries to favor one party or group. Types include:
    - **Partisan Gerrymandering**: Aiming to benefit one political party over another.
    - **Racial and Ethnic Gerrymandering**: Creating districts to increase the likelihood of electing minority representatives.

### Supreme Court and District Boundaries

#### Key Cases

- **Baker v. Carr (1962)**: Established the principle of "one person, one vote," requiring districts to have roughly the same number of constituents.
- **Shaw v. Reno (1993)**: Ruled against racial gerrymandering that resulted in bizarrely shaped districts, emphasizing that race can be a consideration in redistricting but not the main factor.

### Advantages of Incumbency

- Incumbents have significant advantages, including name recognition, access to media, and the ability to claim credit for legislative achievements, which contribute to high reelection rates.

#### Incumbency in Different Offices

- **House of Representatives**: Incumbents benefit from frequent elections (every two years) and often represent safe districts.
- **Senate**: Senators have longer terms and represent entire states, making voter outreach more challenging and reducing incumbency advantages compared to the House.

### Factors Affecting Congressional Elections

- **Experience and Money**: Critical for challengers to mount effective campaigns. Incumbents' advantages and the high cost of campaigns make it difficult for new candidates.
- **Maximizing the Advantage**: Incumbents use strategies such as advertising, claiming credit for legislative achievements, and performing casework to secure reelection.
