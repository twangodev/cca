# 9 - Civil Rights: What is Equality?

## Securing Rights for Those with Disabilities

### Judith Heumann's Advocacy

- **Judith Heumann** was a special advisor for international disability rights with the U.S. Department of State. She published an article in January 2016 emphasizing the importance of inclusion and full participation of individuals with disabilities in democracy, reflecting on Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of justice for all.

- Heumann contracted polio in 1949, leading to her requirement of a wheelchair. She faced discrimination early on, being denied access to public school in the 1950s due to the lack of ramps and was labeled a "fire hazard".

- Despite obstacles, Heumann obtained two degrees, including a master of arts from the University of California at Berkeley in 1975. She filed and won a lawsuit against New York City schools for rejecting her teacher application based on her disability.

### Major Contributions to Disability Rights

- **Section 504 Sit-Ins (1977):** Heumann played a significant role in organizing rallies and sit-ins to demand the enforcement of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the first federal law to prohibit discrimination against Americans with disabilities. The most notable sit-in took place in San Francisco, leading to the endorsement of the regulations by the secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

- **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990):** Heumann's efforts were pivotal in the passing of the ADA, signed into law by President George H. W. Bush. The ADA ensures non-discrimination in employment, buying goods and services, and participating in government programs for people with disabilities. It required modifications in public buildings for better accessibility but did not provide federal funding for these changes, illustrating an unfunded mandate.

### Connection to Civil Rights

- Advocates for the rights of Americans with disabilities, including Heumann, have drawn parallels between their struggles and those of African Americans, inspired by the civil rights movements of the 1960s. Through lobbying, litigation, public education, and advocacy, significant legal and societal advancements have been made toward equality and inclusiveness for people with disabilities.

## The Fight Against Segregation

### Historical Background

- **Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857):** The Supreme Court ruled that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, were not American citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. This decision intensified the national debate over slavery.

- **Emancipation Proclamation:** Issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, it declared that all slaves in Confederate states were to be set free.

### Post-Civil War Amendments

- **Thirteenth Amendment (1865):** Abolished slavery in the United States.
- **Fourteenth Amendment (1868):** Granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, including former slaves, and provided all citizens with equal protection under the laws.
- **Fifteenth Amendment (1870):** Granted African American men the right to vote.

### Jim Crow Laws and Segregation

- Southern states implemented Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation. These laws, along with poll taxes and literacy tests, effectively disenfranchised African Americans.
- **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896):** The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the "separate but equal" doctrine.

### Civil Rights Movement

- **Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP:** Led efforts to challenge segregation, focusing on legal strategies to combat racial discrimination.

- **Brown v. Board of Education (1954):** The Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning Plessy v. Ferguson. This decision marked a significant victory for the civil rights movement but led to widespread resistance in the South.

### Continued Struggle for Equality

- **De Jure vs. De Facto Segregation:** Legal battles shifted focus from de jure (legal) segregation to de facto (practical) segregation, which resulted from private actions and residential patterns.

- **Affirmative Action:** Policies were implemented to address past discrimination and promote diversity, leading to debates and legal challenges regarding their constitutionality.

### Key Legal and Social Dynamics

- The transition from a focus on ending legal segregation to addressing the broader implications of racial discrimination highlights the ongoing challenges in achieving racial equality.
- Supreme Court decisions have played a crucial role in shaping the legal landscape of civil rights, with significant cases influencing public policy and societal attitudes towards racial discrimination.
