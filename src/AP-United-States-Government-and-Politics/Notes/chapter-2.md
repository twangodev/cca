# 2: The Constitution: A New Vision of Government

## 2.1 The Articles of Confederation

### Background and Ratification
- Adopted in 1777 and ratified in 1781 by the Second Continental Congress.
- Established a union of sovereign states with predominant state authority.

### Concept of "A Firm League of Friendship"
- Aimed to address mutual mistrust among states.
- Provided protections against unilateral territorial claims.
- Ensured equal state representation in Congress.
- Emphasized state sovereignty over national governance.

### Key Provisions and Structure
- Unicameral Congress: Each state had one vote, regardless of size.
- No separate executive or independent judicial branch.
- Required unanimous consent for amendments.
- Limited national government's power: lacked authority in taxation, military funding, and foreign policy.

### Limitations and Challenges
- Ineffective in enforcing policies due to lack of central authority.
- Financial limitations: Relied on states for funding, leading to economic instability.
- Difficulties in foreign policy and interstate commerce due to state control.

### Economic and Political Context Post-Revolution
- Economic hardship and debt crisis.
- Shays's Rebellion: A grassroots uprising against Massachusetts government, highlighting weaknesses in national governance.

### The Annapolis Convention (1786)
- Aimed to address trade disputes.
- Low participation but set the stage for the Philadelphia Convention (1787).

### Impact and Legacy
- Exposed the inadequacy of a weak central government.
- Influenced the development of the U.S. Constitution and stronger federal system.

### Comparisons with the U.S. Constitution
- Articles established a loose union with limited central power.
- U.S. Constitution introduced a stronger federal structure with defined executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

## 2.2: The Constitutional Convention

- Held in May 1787 in Philadelphia.
- Aimed to amend the Articles of Confederation.

- Benjamin Franklin: Contributed despite poor health.
- Alexander Hamilton: Advocated for a strong national government.

### Delegate Demographics
- All male.

### Major Issues Addressed
1. **Representation in Congress**
    - Virginia Plan: Bicameral legislature, representation based on population.
    - New Jersey Plan: Unicameral legislature, equal representation for all states.
    - Great Compromise: Bicameral legislature with a House of Representatives (population-based representation) and a Senate (equal representation).

2. **Individual Rights and Governance**
    - Limited government to protect freedoms.
    - Distributed power to prevent tyranny.
    - Few individual rights in the original Constitution.
    - Specific protections for accused individuals (e.g., habeas corpus, no ex post facto laws).

3. **Slavery**
    - Three-Fifths Compromise: Slaves counted as three-fifths of a person for representation.
    - Compromise on Importation: No restriction on slave trade until 1808.
    - Fugitive Slave Clause: Escaped slaves to be returned to owners.

### Convention Secrecy and Decision-Making
- Proceedings were kept secret to facilitate open debate.
- Decisions driven by practical, political considerations.

### Impact and Legacy
- Established the U.S. Constitution.
- Addressed failures of the Articles of Confederation.
- Created a stronger federal structure.
- Set the stage for future conflicts over slavery and states' rights.
