# Concept FRQ Practice

## Prompt

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the federal agency responsible for the approval, regulation, and control of prescription medications. All prescription medications must complete an extensive FDA approval process, which can take years. In an attempt to expedite this process, Congress passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act in 2009, which created a faster approval pathway for biologic products that are highly similar to existing FDA-approved medications. The law applies only to biologic products, those produced with living organisms, but not to chemically produced drugs. Insulin is a vital prescription medication used to treat diabetes. Over an eight-year period, beginning in 2009, the average price of insulin increased from $90 to $275 a vial. Since insulin was not regulated as a biologic, the time necessary to gain FDA approval prevented new companies from developing less expensive alternatives.

In 2017, public attention to the rising cost of insulin led the FDA to reclassify the drug as a biologic, thereby lessening the amount of time it took for new companies to get FDA approval. With more manufacturers competing in the marketplace, prices would likely drop.

After reading the scenario, respond to 1, 2, and 3 below.

1. Referencing the scenario, describe the executive branch authority used by the FDA in reclassifying insulin as a biologic and explain how this use of the FDA’s authority might affect the success of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.
2. Referencing the scenario, explain how Congress could have addressed the increasing cost of insulin prior to 2017.
3. Describe an informal power the president could use to influence the FDA’s decision to reclassify insulin as a biologic. Explain how the use of that informal power relates to the principle of separation of powers.

## Response

1. The FDA utilized its regulatory authority by reclassifying insulin as a biologic, leveraging executive branch powers to enforce and interpret the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. This decision broadened the scope of the Act, facilitating a quicker approval process for biosimilar products of insulin, which was previously categorized outside of this streamlined pathway. By doing so, the FDA aimed to increase market competition for insulin, likely leading to lower prices and improved access for patients. This action exemplifies how the FDA's use of authority can directly influence the healthcare market and potentially enhance the effectiveness of healthcare legislation.
2. Prior to 2017, Congress could have taken legislative actions to mitigate the rising costs of insulin, such as enacting laws to regulate drug pricing directly or to promote generic and biosimilar competition. They could have also amended existing healthcare legislation to specifically include provisions for essential medications like insulin, ensuring faster approval processes or price controls. Another approach could have involved increasing funding or resources to the FDA to expedite the review and approval of affordable insulin alternatives. These steps would have demonstrated a proactive approach to healthcare policy, addressing the affordability and accessibility of crucial medications.
3. The President could use the power of persuasion as an informal tool to influence the FDA's decision-making, by publicly addressing the issue of high insulin prices and advocating for the reclassification of insulin as a biologic. This strategy could involve speeches, social media campaigns, or engaging with stakeholders to raise awareness and build public support for the change. Such actions wouldn't directly alter FDA policies but could generate significant public and political pressure, leading to quicker regulatory adjustments. This use of informal presidential power highlights the interplay between public opinion, executive influence, and regulatory decision-making within the framework of the U.S. government's separation of powers.
