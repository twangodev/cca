# Gideon vs. Wainwright

### Background

- **Name of the Case:** Gideon v. Wainwright
- **Year Decided:** 1963
- **Facts:** Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with felony breaking and entering in Florida. He appeared in court without a lawyer and requested that the court appoint one for him, arguing that the Sixth Amendment constitutionally guaranteed him the right to counsel. The court denied his request, stating that under Florida law, counsel could only be appointed for capital offenses. Gideon represented himself in trial and was convicted.
- **Issue:** The main issue was whether the right to counsel guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment applies to defendants in state courts under the Fourteenth Amendment.
- **Decision:** The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the right to counsel is a fundamental right essential to a fair trial, which states are required to uphold under the Fourteenth Amendment.
- **Majority Decision Reasoning:** The Court reasoned that a fair trial cannot be guaranteed without the assistance of counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to respect the fundamental rights established in the Bill of Rights, including the right to counsel in criminal cases.
- **Dissenting Opinion Reasoning:** There was no dissenting opinion in this case; the decision was unanimous.
- **Impact of the Case:** The decision significantly expanded the rights of accused persons under the U.S. Constitution, ensuring that indigent defendants are provided with counsel in all criminal cases that could result in imprisonment. This marked a pivotal moment in the American legal system, emphasizing the importance of a fair trial and the right to legal representation.

### Questions

- Why was certiorari granted in Gideon's case?

    Certiorari was granted in Gideon's case to address a significant question of federal law regarding the right to counsel for indigent defendants under the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The case presented an opportunity to reevaluate the Court's decision in Betts v. Brady, which had held that the appointment of counsel was not a fundamental right for state criminal defendants unless special circumstances required it.

- What part of the Betts decision does the court agree with? How does this decision disagree with Betts?

    The Court in Gideon v. Wainwright agreed with the underlying principle in Betts that the right to counsel is essential to a fair trial. However, it disagreed with the Betts decision by rejecting the notion that this right was not fundamental and thus not applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Gideon overruled Betts, establishing that the right to counsel is a fundamental right for all defendants in state criminal trials, regardless of the presence of "special circumstances."

- How does Justice Harlan then "bury" the Betts case in the following paragraph?

    Justice Harlan, in his concurrence, essentially "buried" Betts by supporting the Court's decision to overrule it. He argued that the Betts decision was an aberration in the Court's constitutional jurisprudence regarding the rights of the accused. By highlighting the evolution of the Court's understanding and the importance of counsel in ensuring a fair trial, Harlan reinforced the reasoning behind fully integrating the Sixth Amendment's protections into the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guarantees for state defendants.

- Does Justice Harlan consider the precedent of the Betts case to be still in effect? How has the definition of "special circumstances" changed?

    Justice Harlan did not consider the precedent of the Betts case to still be in effect following Gideon. The definition of "special circumstances" effectively became moot because Gideon eliminated the need for such circumstances to be present for the right to counsel to apply. Instead, the right to counsel was recognized as a fundamental and universal right for all criminal defendants facing serious charges in both federal and state courts.

- How does Justice Harlan interpret the evolution of the "special circumstances" rule?

    Justice Harlan interpreted the evolution of the "special circumstances" rule as indicative of the broader judicial and societal recognition that access to counsel is essential for a fair trial. He viewed the rule's application in Betts as overly restrictive and not in keeping with the fundamental principles of justice and due process. By embracing a more inclusive understanding of the Sixth Amendment, Harlan and the Court acknowledged that the complexities of modern criminal prosecutions necessitate the assistance of counsel for all defendants to ensure equality before the law.
