# Schenck vs. United States

## Background

- **Name of the Case:** Schenck v. United States
- **Year Decided:** 1919
- **Facts:** Charles Schenck, a secretary of the Socialist Party in the United States, was charged with conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act of 1917 by attempting to cause insubordination in the military and to obstruct recruitment. Schenck and his co-defendants distributed leaflets to draftees during World War I, which declared the draft unconstitutional and urged draftees to assert their rights.
- **Issue:** The central legal issue was whether Schenck's actions, specifically his distribution of anti-draft leaflets, constituted a criminal offense under the Espionage Act of 1917, or whether they were protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
- **Decision:** The Supreme Court upheld Schenck's conviction, ruling that his actions were not protected by the First Amendment in the context of wartime, as they posed a "clear and present danger" to the United States' recruitment efforts during World War I.
- **Majority Decision Reasoning:** The majority, led by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., argued that the context of war allowed for greater restrictions on speech. Holmes introduced the "clear and present danger" test, stating that speech could be restricted if it posed a clear and present danger to a government interest deemed important enough.
- **Dissenting Opinion Reasoning:** There was no formal dissent in the case; however, later cases and critiques have questioned the broad application of the "clear and present danger" test and its impact on free speech.
- **Impact of the Case:** Schenck v. United States established the "clear and present danger" test as a standard for determining when speech is not protected under the First Amendment due to national security concerns. This decision has had a lasting impact on First Amendment jurisprudence, although the strictness of its application has varied over time.
