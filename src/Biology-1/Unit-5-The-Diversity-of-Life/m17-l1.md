# Module 17 Lesson 1 Progress Check

## Prompt

1. **Diagram** a bacterium.
2. **Discuss** possible rationales that taxonomists might have used when deciding to group prokaryotes into two distinct domains instead of one group.
3. **Explain** survival mechanisms of bacteria at both the individual and population levels.
4. **List** three ways bacteria are beneficial to humans.
5. **Analyze the difficulty in understanding the diversity in prokaryotes compared to plants and animals.**
6. **Math Connection** Imagine that today at 1 p.m., a single *Salmonella* bacterial cell landed on potato salad sitting on your kitchen counter. Assuming your kitchen provides an optimal environment for bacterial growth, how many bacterial cells will be present at 3 p.m. today?

## Response

1. A bacterium can be illustrated as a microscopic entity comprising a cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a nucleoid, and occasionally flagella and pili. These components collectively enable the bacterium to sustain life, reproduce, and interact with its environment, making it a fundamental unit of life.

2. The classification of prokaryotes into two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, is primarily based on significant genetic differences and variations in cell membrane and wall compositions. These distinctions, highlighted by molecular studies such as ribosomal RNA sequences, suggest a profound evolutionary split, justifying their separation into two domains.

3. Bacteria employ various survival mechanisms including spore formation for enduring adverse conditions, rapid mutation for adapting to environmental stresses, and horizontal gene transfer for acquiring beneficial traits. At the population level, genetic diversity, quorum sensing for coordinated behaviors, and metabolic flexibility ensure their survival and proliferation across diverse environments.

4. Bacteria benefit humans by aiding in digestion and synthesizing essential vitamins within the gut microbiome, cleaning up environmental pollutants through bioremediation, and contributing to biotechnology and medicine by producing antibiotics, insulin, and other crucial substances.

5. Understanding prokaryotic diversity is challenging due to their microscopic size, vast numbers and ubiquity, frequent horizontal gene transfer, difficulty in culturing many species in laboratories, and their rapid evolution. These factors make the study and classification of prokaryotes particularly complex compared to plants and animals.

6. Assuming optimal growth conditions for *Salmonella*, which can double in number approximately every 20 minutes, a single bacterial cell can proliferate to 64 cells in two hours. This example illustrates the potential for rapid bacterial growth under suitable conditions.
