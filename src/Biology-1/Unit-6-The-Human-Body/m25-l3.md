Answer the "Check Your Progress" questions (p687 #1, 2, 4, and an additional question below) and submit your answers here.

## Response

1. **Explain** the reasons why a feedback system would be referred to as "negative feedback."

    Negative feedback in a system acts to reverse changes and maintain stability or homeostasis. It is vital in biological systems, ensuring conditions remain within safe limits. For example, if body temperature rises, negative feedback mechanisms work to cool the body down.

2. **Predict** when high levels of insulin would be found in a person's blood and when high levels of glucagon would be found in a person's blood.

    High levels of insulin are found in the blood after eating, particularly carbohydrates, to help lower blood glucose levels. Conversely, high levels of glucagon occur when blood sugar is low, signaling the liver to release glucose. Both hormones are critical for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels.

3. **Identify** and describe the functions of pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, and adrenal glands. 

    The pituitary gland regulates growth, blood pressure, and other functions, acting as the bodyâ€™s "master gland." The thyroid regulates metabolism and growth, while the parathyroid glands manage blood calcium levels. The pancreas controls blood sugar levels through insulin and glucagon, and the adrenal glands manage stress responses and various metabolic processes.

4. In the agricultural industry, especially cattleHormones are used in cattle farming to promote growth and milk production, with the FDA stating that these practices are safe for human consumption. However, some concerns and debates persist regarding potential long-term impacts on human health. The European Union has banned growth hormones in cattle farming, reflecting a more precautionary approach., there's the issue of hormones being used on cattle. Do your research whether the use of hormone on cattle could impact the health of humans when we consume cattle which have elevated levels of certain hormones such as growth hormones. Cite your source.
