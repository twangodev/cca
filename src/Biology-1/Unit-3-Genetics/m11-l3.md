# Module 11 Lesson 3 Progress Check

## Prompt

## Response

1. **Summarize** the process by which the DNA code results in the production of a protein.

    The process starts with transcription, where DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by RNA polymerase. The mRNA then travels to the ribosome, where translation occurs, reading the mRNA sequence to synthesize proteins with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA). This process converts the genetic code into a sequence of amino acids, forming a protein.

2. **Describe** the function of each of the following in protein synthesis: rRNA, mRNA, tRNA.

    rRNA (ribosomal RNA) forms the core of the ribosome's structure and catalyzes protein synthesis. mRNA (messenger RNA) carries the genetic blueprint from DNA to the ribosome, where it guides the sequence in which amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNA (transfer RNA) matches amino acids to the corresponding codons on the mRNA during protein synthesis, facilitating the correct assembly of proteins.

3. **Explain** the role of RNA polymerase in mRNA synthesis.

    RNA polymerase initiates mRNA synthesis by binding to the promoter region of a gene, unwinding the DNA, and synthesizing a complementary mRNA strand from the DNA template. It moves along the DNA, elongating the mRNA strand until it reaches a terminator sequence, where transcription ends. This enzyme is crucial for transcribing the genetic information from DNA into a form that can be used to produce proteins.

4. **Math Connection** If the genetic code used four bases as a code instead of three, how many code units could be encoded?

    With four bases in a code unit, the number of possible codons increases exponentially to 256 possible combinations. This expansion from the 64 combinations available with three-base codons would allow for a significantly greater diversity of genetic encoding. Such a system could potentially encode a much wider variety of amino acids and regulatory instructions, enhancing the complexity and versatility of genetic information.
