- Volkognov's main claim in the article is that yes, Lenin did sow the seeds for Stalinism
- Article claims that "It was Lenin who initiated the subordination of human life to ideological objectives without regard to the number of lives lost"
    - Argues that it was Lenin who introduced executions, mass terror, concetration camps, and slave labor
- Focuses on the "legalization of terror" and provides examples such as…
    - Cheka shootings was the thousands in cellars without trial

    - Heartless acceptance of mass starvation
        - 25 million people were starving at the same time funds were sent overseas to help Communist parties in 1921-1922
    - These examples barely scratch the surface of what Volkogonov recounts from his archives
