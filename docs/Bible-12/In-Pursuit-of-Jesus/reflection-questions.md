# In Pursuit of Jesus Reflection Questions

## Prompt
1. What do you think that it means to pursue Jesus? Is there a difference between our pursuit of Him and His pursuit of us?
2. Consider some of the key themes expressed throughout the series: Food, Culture, Hospitality, Liberation, Christianity’s Historical Oppressive nature, Intentionality, Work/Vocational Calling, Art, Suffering, Accountability, Deep Friendships, etc. How have you seen these themes show up in your own life (not just in pursuit of faith)? How have these ideas maybe challenged what you thought Christianity was or is? How have the lived experiences of those Berry encounters and speaks with given new meaning to these concepts and their relationship with faith?
3. Can you personally identify with any of the stories of those Berry engages with throughout the series? How so?
4. How might this experience change the way you think about Christianity? Pursuing a relationship with Jesus? Thinking more broadly about expressions of faith?
5. Are there places, stories, people that were left out of this series who we need to consider to fully gain an understanding of Christianity and what it means to pursue Jesus? Be fair. Consider budgetary restrictions, areas represented (New York, Singapore, Sweden, Argentina, South Africa, and Jerusalem), etc.

## Response

1. This usually implies seeking to understand his teachings, life, and significance, and trying to align one's life with those teachings and values. The Christian narrative posits that while individuals might pursue a relationship with Jesus, there's also the belief in Jesus (or God) pursuing humanity — this is seen in concepts like grace and salvation.
2. Food, Culture, and Hospitality. These are often central in asian culture, where asking whether or not one ate is apart of social customs. I don't think this perspective has neccisarily challanged what I thought what Christianity was - there is a very clear social aspect that is apart of it. Sharing meals and opening one's home can bridge cultural and religious divides.
3. Trying to initially wrap my head around the fact that food can be used as a social element. When I was younger, I never necessarily realized that food could be used in such a manner and in general, found it a bit pointless.
4. For me, understanding the diverse cultural and historical contexts of Christianity allowed me to gain a deeper insight about the meaning of faith. But I don't think I understand or see my self aligning with the full picture yet.
5. Considering the rise of Christianity in Eastern Asia (where religion is often put second), countries like China or South Korea could offer unique perspectives. Every region and culture will have its unique relationship with Christianity and its understanding of pursuing Jesus.
