# Pt 5: 3-4

## Prompt
1. How does the Lord’s Prayer invite us to view God as both tender and terrifying?
2. Have you heard people say cliches about Heaven like “This World is not my home” and “just passing through”? If so, how have you responded in those moments? How does this view diminish both the promise of eternal life and our view of our Earthly neighbors?
3. How can you balance our call to transform the Earth while maintaining the hope and promise of eternal life that Christians proclaim in Christ?  

## Response
1. The Lord's Prayer portrays God as tender through its use of "Our Father," suggesting a nurturing, close relationship, and terrifying in acknowledging God's immense power and holiness.
2. Clichés like "This World is not my home" can make earthly life seem less important, potentially diminishing our responsibility to our neighbors and the planet.
3. Balancing earthly duties with the hope of eternal life involves recognizing the importance of improving the world now, while also holding onto the belief in an afterlife promised in Christian faith.
