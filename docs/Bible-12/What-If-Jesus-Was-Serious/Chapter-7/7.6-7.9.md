# Pt. 7: 6-9

## Prompt

Read #51 (134-135), #52 (136-137), #53 (138-139), and #54 (140-141) and answer the following questions.

1. How do see "no" as being as way that our parents and ultimately God show their love for us?
2. How are you devoted to the "good" of those around you? Where have you fallen short in this pursuit of devotion to others?
3. Complete the prayer exercise on p. 141. Reflect on the experience of praying and asking what these people would want from you today.

## Response

1. Saying "no" is a form of protection and guidance from our parents and, in a broader sense, God, showing care and foresight for our wellbeing, even if it doesn't always feel that way. It's a reminder that love isn't just about granting wishes but also about keeping us safe from harm we might not foresee.
2. I try to support those around me, but balancing school, activities, and personal time makes it tough; my devotion to others is a work in progress, learning that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference.
3. Engaging in the prayer exercise of empathizing with difficult people in my life and considering what they would want from me fosters a profound sense of empathy and humility. It's a challenging yet rewarding reflection that prompts me to act towards others with the kindness and understanding I seek for myself, encouraging personal growth and deeper connections.
