1. What qualities do you look for in a (Christian) leader? What are you drawn to those qualities?

3. Where in your life have you seen an example similar to Moses in this passage? Explain.
4. How have you or others youâ€™ve seen been impacted by the danger of missionalism? Explain.

## Response

1. In a Christian leader, you would generally look for integrity, empathy, and a genuine concern for others, qualities that speak to universal human values.
2. To me, submission is about recognizing and respecting authority or expertise in others, often challenging due to a desire for autonomy and skepticism of others' intentions or competence.
3. An example similar to Moses would be a teacher who, despite facing skepticism and challenges from students and faculty, persevered to implement a new, beneficial educational program, demonstrating leadership and commitment.
4. The danger of missionalism, or becoming overly focused on a single cause to the detriment of broader responsibilities, can lead to burnout and neglect of personal relationships, as seen in activists who become consumed by their work.
