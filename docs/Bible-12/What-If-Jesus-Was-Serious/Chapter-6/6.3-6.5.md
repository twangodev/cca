# Pt. 6: 3-5

## Prompt
Week Eighteen: Read #38 (106-107), #39 (108-109) and #40 (110-111) and answer the following questions. 

1. How do we recognize and celebrate the “treasures” that God provides to us while on Earth instead of looking toward future blessings?
2. How does your heart point toward your ultimate concern? How do our other “penultimate” concerns lead us to that ultimate concern?
3. How can we be more generous with the blessings that God has given us? When habits of generosity can we start and practice as we prepare to graduate and go to college/enter military/career?
4. How does Deuteronomy 15 help lay a template for how we should view others of varying socio-economic status? How easy of a template is this for us to follow? Explain.

## Response

1. We can recognize and celebrate God's treasures by appreciating the everyday blessings in our lives, such as family, friends, and nature, and expressing gratitude for them. This helps us focus on the present rather than solely looking forward to future blessings.
2. Our heart's direction towards our ultimate concern highlights what truly matters to us, with our various interests and responsibilities guiding us towards understanding our deeper values and purpose in life.
3. To be more generous with our blessings, we can start by sharing our time, kindness, and resources with others, building habits of generosity that become part of our character as we move into new life stages.
4. Deuteronomy 15 encourages viewing everyone as equals and showing compassion regardless of socio-economic status, a principle that can be challenging to follow but is essential for fostering empathy and understanding in society.
