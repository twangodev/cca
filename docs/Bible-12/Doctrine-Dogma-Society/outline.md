# Outline

## Introduction
Brief introduction to the doctrines of the Church and Salvation, the dogma of the Sabbath, and the issue of marijuana.

### Thesis Statement
By integrating the doctrines of the Church and Salvation with the Sabbath dogma, Christians can formulate a principled yet compassionate stance on marijuana legalization, balancing ethical considerations with societal needs.

## Theological Foundations

### Doctrine of the Church (Source: Heinrich Vogel)

Discuss the Church's universal and local roles, focusing on its mission and how it shapes its stance on ethical issues like marijuana.


!!! quote "Definition and Essence of the Church"
    "The church consists of sanctified believers in Christ... described as using the Word and the sacraments... They practice their faith, congregate for public worship, pray, and practice Christian fellowship" (Vogel).

    This quote encapsulates the core definition of the Church as a community of believers unified through faith and practice, which is foundational for discussing the Church's role in ethical issues like marijuana.

!!! quote "Marks of the Church"
    "Wherever the means of grace are in use, where the gospel is rightly taught and the sacraments are rightly administered, there the church must be present, since these are the means whereby believers are brought to faith" (Vogel).

    Vogel's emphasis on the correct teaching of the gospel and administration of sacraments as marks of the true Church is crucial for understanding how the Church maintains its doctrinal integrity and guides ethical behavior.

!!! quote "Invisible and Visible Aspects of the Church"
    "The church is invisible to man... We can only detect its presence by the profession of faith which believers make" (Vogel).

    The concept of the Church as both visible (in its congregations and practices) and invisible (in its spiritual communion) allows for a nuanced discussion of how the Church interacts with societal issues from a position that transcends physical or legislative boundaries.

!!! quote "Role and Mission of the Church"
    "The Lord has given his church one task to perform in the world, to 'go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature'" (Vogel).

    This directive is foundational for analyzing how the Church's mission impacts its stance on social issues like marijuana, emphasizing outreach and teaching as methods of influence.

!!! quote "Church and State Distinction"
    "The church and the state have entirely different tasks, engage in entirely different activities, and function with entirely different means" (Vogel).

    This distinction is vital for discussing how the Church should approach legal and ethical issues surrounding marijuana without overstepping its spiritual mandate.

- Church's Universal and Local Roles: Vogel's discussion highlights that the Church operates both universally (invisible church) and locally (visible congregations). In the context of marijuana, this dual role suggests that while the universal Church might guide overarching ethical standards, local congregations can address specific community needs and legal contexts.
- Ethical Guidance and Doctrinal Integrity: The Church's reliance on scripture and sacraments as marks of its true nature underscores its role in providing ethical guidance. This is particularly relevant in forming a response to marijuana use, where ethical and moral considerations are paramount.
- Mission-Oriented Approach: Vogel's emphasis on the Church's mission to preach the gospel implies that its approach to social issues should be proactive and educational, rather than merely reactive. In terms of marijuana, this could mean focusing on educational programs that align with Christian teachings about the body and mind.
- Navigating Church-State Relationships: By distinguishing the roles of Church and state, Vogel provides a framework for the Church to engage with social issues like marijuana legalization through advocacy and moral leadership without encroaching on governmental jurisdiction.

### Doctrine of Salvation (Source: E. Edward Zinke)

Present the role of doctrine in deepening faith and influencing moral behavior, crucial for understanding Christian behavior towards marijuana.

!!! quote "Essence and Goal of Christianity"
    "The sum of Christianity is to come to a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ... The goal of salvation is to enter into a full, rewarding, and mature fellowship with God and Jesus Christ that begins in the present and will last for eternity" (Zinke).

    This emphasizes that Christianity focuses on knowing God personally and that doctrines facilitate this deepening relationship.

!!! quote "Role of Doctrine in Christianity"
    "Doctrines are essential to our relationship with God, for they provide the information we need to enter into deeper communion with Him" (Zinke).

    Doctrine serves as a bridge to understanding and connecting with God, highlighting its importance in guiding moral and ethical behavior.

!!! quote "Integration of Doctrine and Christian Life"
    "A vital relationship exists between doctrine and Christian living... The Sabbath, for example, tells us that God is our Creator, our Redeemer, and the One who holds our future in His hands" (Zinke).

    This quote can be applied to the context of moral decisions regarding marijuana, showing how understanding and adhering to doctrines like the Sabbath can inform Christian ethical stances.

!!! quote "Doctrine as a Systematic Whole"
    "All biblical doctrines comprise a beautiful mosaic and must be viewed as a whole... We might be sitting in the same place, but the picture is not the same" (Zinke).

    This highlights the interconnectedness of doctrines and their collective impact on understanding God’s will and character, which is crucial for ethical decision-making.

- Deepening Faith Through Doctrine: Zinke's insights stress that salvation and doctrine are not mutually exclusive; rather, doctrine deepens understanding and faith, which are essential for fostering a righteous life. In the context of marijuana, this means that understanding doctrines can help Christians navigate the complexities of legal and ethical issues surrounding its use.
- Doctrine's Role in Moral Guidance: By explaining the integral role of doctrines like the Sabbath in defining our relationship with God, Zinke provides a framework for how Christians might view and respond to modern challenges such as marijuana use, emphasizing dependence on God's guidance rather than societal norms.
- Doctrine as a Comprehensive Framework: The idea that removing a single doctrine can alter the entire theological landscape parallels how understanding or misunderstanding one aspect of Christian teaching (like human freedom and responsibility) could affect attitudes towards marijuana. It underscores the importance of a holistic understanding of Christian doctrine in forming balanced and informed ethical views.
- Personal Relationship with God Through Doctrine: Zinke argues that doctrines are not merely theological positions but are essential for knowing God and His expectations. This personal relationship, informed by doctrine, guides believers in their daily choices and interactions, including those related to social and moral issues like marijuana usage.

### Dogma of the Sabbath (Source: V. Norskov Olsen)

Examine the foundational role of the Sabbath in Christian life, suggesting how it might inform lifestyle choices including the use of substances like marijuana.

!!! quote "The Sabbath as a Constitutive and Corrective Norm"
    Olsen describes the Sabbath as "a doctrine which at all times is a tuning fork, by which one can ascertain whether or not the other doctrines are in tune both on the spiritual and on the pragmatic levels" (Olsen).

    This concept emphasizes the Sabbath as a foundational principle that influences and aligns other Christian doctrines and behaviors, including lifestyle choices regarding health and substance use.

!!! quote "Sabbath and the Correct God-Concept"
    "The theology of the Sabbath restores the right God-concept: a transcendent God who is absolute, personal, and holy; the Creator and Sustainer of the universe" (Olsen).

    Olsen argues that the Sabbath reinforces the belief in a personal, creative God, counteracting modern atheistic and naturalistic trends. This concept can be pivotal in shaping views on marijuana, framing it within the context of creation and stewardship.

!!! quote "Sabbath as Reminder of Divine Action"
    "The weekly Sabbath is a reminder that God acts in history, and he sanctifies time and events taking place within history" (Olsen).

    The Sabbath, by highlighting God's active role in history, can influence how believers view time and their actions within it, including decisions about marijuana use in terms of legality, morality, and health.

- Role of the Sabbath in Ethical Decisions: Olsen's portrayal of the Sabbath as both a constitutive and corrective norm suggests it can serve as a moral compass. This is particularly relevant in making ethical decisions about marijuana, where considerations of health, legality, and personal discipline intersect with faith.
- Sabbath’s Influence on Lifestyle Choices: The idea that the Sabbath serves to remind believers of their creation in God's image and their purpose can directly impact lifestyle choices. For instance, the use of marijuana, whether for medical or recreational purposes, can be evaluated against Sabbath principles such as rest, reflection, and rejuvenation, as well as avoidance of any practice that might impair one's ability to honor God's creation.
- Integration of Sabbath Observance with Daily Living: Olsen's discussion about the Sabbath influencing not just spiritual but practical living underscores how this observance could guide actions throughout the week, including attitudes towards substances like marijuana. This might mean advocating for moderation, legality, and ethical sourcing, aligning with broader Sabbath values of justice and care for creation.

## Marijuana in Contemporary Society

### Historical and Legal Background (Source: John T. Doyle)

Outline the legal challenges and status of marijuana, linking religious freedom debates to current policy discussions.

!!! quote "Legal Challenges and Religious Freedom"
    "Several issues inevitably arise in the first amendment area. Can otherwise criminal activity be excused because it is claimed to be a religious practice?" This quote highlights the fundamental question at the heart of the debate between religious freedom and drug laws.

!!! quote "Supreme Court’s Stance"
    "A key dichotomy in free exercise analysis was established in 1872 in the case of Reynolds v. United States... The Supreme Court rejected his argument, saying: '[l]aws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.'"

    This establishes a precedent that while religious beliefs are protected absolutely, religious practices can be regulated.

!!! quote "State vs. Religious Practices"
    "Only those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion."

    This statement underscores the high threshold that must be met for the state to legally restrict religious practices, emphasizing the protected status of religious freedom under U.S. law.

- Interplay Between Drug Laws and Religious Freedom: The legal landscape surrounding the use of drugs for religious purposes is complicated by the need to balance individual religious freedoms with public health and safety concerns. The Supreme Court has set a precedent that while religious beliefs are inviolable, religious practices can be regulated, particularly if they pose a threat to public order or violate existing laws.
- Challenges in Defining Religious Practices: A significant challenge in cases like these is defining what constitutes a religious practice versus a belief and where the line should be drawn. This is crucial in determining whether specific actions protected under the guise of religious practice can supersede state laws, such as those regulating drug use.
- Implications for Policy Discussions: The ongoing legal battles and the precedents set by the courts influence current policy discussions on drug use and religious freedom. They prompt a reevaluation of existing laws to accommodate an increasingly pluralistic society where traditional drug use may be integral to religious ceremonies of minority cultures, such as those of Native Americans.
- Potential for Policy Reformation: The discussion points toward the possibility of reforming drug policies to better accommodate religious practices without compromising public safety. This involves recognizing religious practices involving drugs while also implementing strict regulations to prevent abuse.

### Public Health and Ethical Concerns (Source: James Goben)

Discuss the intersection of marijuana with public health and Christian ethical considerations.

!!! quote "Medical Benefits of Marijuana"
    "Marijuana doesn’t have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works." – Dr. Sanjay Gupta

    This quote highlights the recognition of marijuana's medical benefits, even by well-known medical professionals, which can alleviate symptoms in conditions where other medications might fail.

!!! quote "Biblical References and Ethical Considerations"
    "Perhaps it would be less of a volatile subject if Jesus had said, 'Thou shalt not smoke the wacky tobbacy' or if Paul had told Timothy to occasionally have a toke for his ailments."

    This playful hypothetical underscores the absence of direct biblical prohibitions against substances like marijuana, suggesting that ethical controversies surrounding its use might stem from cultural interpretations rather than explicit religious doctrines.

!!! quote "Paul's Advice on Medicinal Use of Wine"
    "Paul tells Timothy, 'Don’t continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.'"

    This scriptural reference is used to illustrate that the Bible acknowledges and condones the use of substances (in this case, wine) for their medicinal properties, potentially analogous to the use of medical marijuana today.

- Medical Perspective on Marijuana: The acknowledgment of marijuana's medical applications by authorities like Dr. Gupta supports the argument that marijuana can play a beneficial role in healthcare. Its ability to treat symptoms not alleviable by other treatments makes it a critical option in palliative care, particularly for chemotherapy patients and those with chronic pain or neurological disorders.
- Christian Ethical Considerations: The article explores the ethical implications of marijuana use within a Christian context, noting the lack of specific biblical directives regarding such modern issues. This absence suggests that ethical debates on marijuana may need to consider broader Christian principles such as compassion, healing, and the alleviation of suffering rather than looking for direct prohibitions or endorsements.
- Biblical Analogy with Wine: By comparing marijuana to wine, which is biblically endorsed for medicinal use, the article opens a discussion on the potential acceptance of marijuana if viewed through a similar lens. This comparison challenges Christian communities to reevaluate their stance on marijuana, particularly in contexts where it is used to relieve suffering.
- Cultural vs. Scriptural Prohibitions: The discussion suggests that much of the opposition to marijuana might be culturally rather than scripturally based. This distinction is crucial for communities interpreting ancient texts to guide modern life, emphasizing the need to distinguish between cultural biases and religious teachings.
- Navigating Convictions and Commands: The article touches on the importance of distinguishing between personal convictions and scriptural commands. This distinction is vital in discussions about marijuana, where personal beliefs about its use can vary widely. Emphasizing this could lead to a more tolerant and nuanced approach within the Christian community towards those who use marijuana, particularly for medicinal purposes.

## Integrating Doctrine, Dogma, and Social Issue

### Church’s Response to Marijuana (Source: C.S. Lewis)

Use Lewis's discussions on Christian behavior and ethics to discuss potential Christian responses to marijuana legalization.

!!! quote "Human Nature and Moral Law"
    "Every one has heard people quarrelling... They say things like this: ‘How’d you like it if anyone did the same to you?’... He is appealing to some kind of standard of behaviour which he expects the other man to know about."

    This suggests that humans inherently understand a moral law that dictates right and wrong, even if specific actions aren't mentioned in religious texts. Regarding marijuana, Christians might look to the implicit moral understandings shared across humanity to evaluate its use and legalization.

!!! quote "Law of Human Nature"
    "This Law or Rule about Right and Wrong used to be called the Law of Nature... the idea was that, just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation, and organisms by biological laws, so the creature called man also had his law—with this great difference, that a body could not choose whether it obeyed the law of gravitation or not, but a man could choose either to obey the Law of Human Nature or to disobey it."

    Lewis emphasizes the freedom of choice in moral behavior, distinguishing humans from other parts of nature. When considering marijuana, this perspective supports the idea that individuals must decide for themselves, based on an internal moral compass, whether their actions are ethical or beneficial.

!!! quote "Universality of Moral Standards"
    "If they were not [universal], then all the things we said about the war were nonsense. What was the sense in saying the enemy were in the wrong unless Right is a real thing which the Nazis at bottom knew as well as we did and ought to have practised?"

    Lewis argues for universal moral standards, which suggests that debates about marijuana should consider not only legal but also universally recognized ethical implications. Is it harmful or helpful to the individual and society? Does it promote well-being or detract from it?

!!! quote Personal Responsibility and Moral Failure
    "The truth is, we believe in decency so much—we feel the Rule of Law pressing on us so—that we cannot bear to face the fact that we are breaking it, and consequently we try to shift the responsibility."

    Lewis points to the human tendency to justify moral failures. In the context of marijuana, this could lead to self-reflection among Christians on whether opposition to or support for marijuana legalization is truly based on moral reasoning or if it's a reaction to societal pressures or personal biases.

!!! quote "Human Nature and Moral Law"
    "Every one has heard people quarrelling...They say things like this: ‘How’d you like it if anyone did the same to you?’...He is appealing to some kind of standard of behaviour which he expects the other man to know about."

    This indicates that people inherently appeal to a universal moral standard, suggesting that ethical discussions about marijuana should consider commonly accepted moral laws. Christians might debate whether marijuana use aligns with these universal principles of fairness, harm, and benefit to society.

!!! quote "Moral Law as Preventative"
    "Every moral rule is there to prevent a breakdown, or a strain, or a friction, in the running of that machine."

    Lewis views moral rules as necessary for the smooth operation of human society. Applying this to marijuana, one might argue that if its use or legalization causes social strain, discord, or health issues, it should be approached cautiously or possibly opposed. Conversely, if marijuana use under certain conditions alleviates suffering without causing societal harm, it might be seen as permissible.

!!! quote "Personal Responsibility"
    "What is the good of drawing up, on paper, rules for social behaviour, if we know that, in fact, our greed, cowardice, ill temper, and self-conceit are going to prevent us from keeping them?"

    This stresses the importance of personal integrity and self-regulation over merely legal or external rules. For Christians discussing marijuana, this might translate into an emphasis on personal discernment and self-control in its use, rather than relying solely on laws to dictate behavior.

!!! quote "Purpose and Direction"
    "Morality, then, seems to be concerned with three things. Firstly, with fair play and harmony between individuals. Secondly, with tidying up or harmonising the things inside each individual. Thirdly, with the general purpose of human life as a whole..."

    Lewis proposes that morality guides not just interactions among people, but also personal integrity and the broader purpose of life. In terms of marijuana, this could lead Christians to consider how its use impacts not only social interactions and legal systems, but also individual health and spiritual well-being.

!!! quote "Christian Point of View on Morality"
    "It seems, then, that if we are to think about morality, we must think of all three departments: relations between man and man: things inside each man: and relations between man and the power that made him."

    This comprehensive approach to morality suggests that Christians need to consider the legalization of marijuana not just in terms of societal impact, but also its effect on individuals and their relationship with God.

### Salvation and Moral Behavior (Source: E. Edward Zinke)

Tie in the doctrine of Salvation with moral and ethical responses to marijuana, showing how salvation-oriented life perspectives might critique or support marijuana use.

!!! quote "Salvation and Relationship with God"
    "The essence of Christianity is to come to a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ... The goal of salvation is to enter into a full, rewarding, and mature fellowship with God and Jesus Christ that begins in the present and will last for eternity."

    This emphasizes that the core of Christian life is a personal relationship with God, influenced by an understanding of His nature and will as revealed through Jesus Christ. Regarding marijuana, this relationship would guide a believer to consider how their choices either enhance or detract from their spiritual health and alignment with God’s character.

!!! quote "Sin and Separation from God"
    "Our sins have separated us from God... We are not at peace with God because our characters are out of harmony with His."

    This underscores that sin disrupts our relationship with God. If marijuana use is viewed as sinful or leading to sinful behavior (such as impairment of judgment, leading to irresponsible actions), it would be seen as creating a barrier between the individual and God.

!!! quote "Role of Doctrine"
    "To enter a relationship with another person, it is essential to know something about that person... Doctrines are essential to our relationship with God, for they provide the information we need to enter into deeper communion with Him."

    Doctrines help Christians understand what behaviors align with God’s will. If doctrines suggest that sobriety and alertness are values to uphold (as inferred from biblical teachings on sobriety and self-control), then marijuana use might be discouraged.

!!! quote "Restoration through Christ"
    "Even while we were sinners... God reached down through His own Son Jesus Christ so that our fellowship with Him might be restored."

    This implies that Christian responses to marijuana should also consider themes of redemption and restoration. If marijuana use is part of one’s past, the focus would be on how Christ’s salvation can transform and restore.

!!! quote "Practical Application of Doctrine"
    "Imagine a beautiful sandy beach... All biblical doctrines comprise a beautiful mosaic and must be viewed as a whole."

    The holistic view of doctrine suggests that the debate on marijuana should consider broader biblical principles rather than isolated texts. This could lead to a balanced view that weighs marijuana’s medicinal benefits against potential risks and abuses.

!!! quote "Impact of Doctrine on Personal Life"
    "A vital relationship exists between doctrine and Christian living... The Sabbath, for example, tells us that God is our Creator, our Redeemer, and the One who holds our future in his hands."

    This highlights how doctrines shape daily living and ethical decisions. If considering marijuana within this framework, one might reflect on how its use impacts their acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty and care in their life.

### Sabbath Observance and Lifestyle Choices (Source: V. Norskov Olsen)

Link Sabbath principles to choices about rest, recreation, and substance use, suggesting a restorative rather than indulgent approach to lifestyle.

!!! quote "Sabbath as a Corrective Norm"
    "When I speak of the Sabbath as a corrective norm, I mean a doctrine which at all times is a tuning fork, by which one can ascertain whether or not the other doctrines are in tune both on the spiritual and on the pragmatic levels."

    This suggests that the Sabbath serves as a benchmark for aligning all aspects of life, including recreational activities and personal habits, with spiritual principles. It implies that lifestyle choices, such as the use of substances like marijuana, should be evaluated based on their harmony with Sabbath values, which prioritize rest, reflection, and renewal.

!!! quote "Sabbath and the Right God-concept"
    "The Seventh-day Adventist church has correctly emphasized that the theology of the Sabbath restores the right God-concept: a transcendent God who is absolute, personal, and holy; the Creator and Sustainer of the universe."

    This emphasizes the role of the Sabbath in highlighting God as the creator and sustainer, underscoring a lifestyle that reflects this dependence. In terms of substance use, this might mean avoiding anything that undermines the physical or mental health that God sustains, suggesting a critical view towards recreational drug use.

!!! quote "Sabbath and Personal Salvation"
    "The Sabbath, as related to man’s personal salvation, should be a sign of justification and sanctification."

    The concept of sanctification involves growing in holiness and purity, which would likely discourage the use of substances that could impair judgment or lead to dependence. This interpretation would advocate for a lifestyle that enhances clarity of mind and purity of body.

!!! quote "Sabbath as a Sign of the Covenant"
    "The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant that teaches us not to have but to be, not to own but to give, not to control but to share."

    This quote suggests a lifestyle that values generosity, community, and self-control over indulgence and selfishness. When applied to recreational activities or substance use, it supports choices that foster community and spiritual health rather than isolation or self-gratification.

!!! quote "Sabbath and Eschatology"
    "In the Old Testament the Sabbath is closely linked to the world to come."

    This future-oriented view of the Sabbath reminds believers to live in a way that prepares for eternity. This perspective might discourage engagement with practices like recreational drug use, which could be seen as detracting from one's spiritual readiness and eternal focus.

## Empirical Insights and Public Opinion

### Religiosity and Marijuana Legalization (Source: Jasmine M. Hernandez)

Present empirical evidence on how differing levels of religiosity affect views on marijuana legalization, demonstrating the practical influence of Church doctrine on public opinions.

!!! quote "Empirical Findings"
    "Controlling for demographic, political, and economic covariates, religious service attendance (attachment) and belief in the Bible as God’s word (belief) are found to be significant independent variables."

    This indicates a clear link between higher levels of religiosity, specifically frequent attendance at religious services and literal belief in the Bible, and opposition to marijuana legalization. The study suggests that stronger religious commitments directly influence negative attitudes toward the legalization of marijuana.

!!! quote "Significance of Religious Service Attendance and Bible Literalism"
    "Religious service attendance and believing the Bible to be the actual word of God are consistent with Krystosek’s (2016) results as both are found to be strong predictors influencing society’s opinions on marijuana legalization."

    This demonstrates that specific religious practices and beliefs play a crucial role in shaping public opinion on social issues like marijuana legalization. The findings underscore the practical influence of religious doctrine on public opinions, as adherence to certain religious tenets correlates with specific societal views.

!!! quote "Change Over Time in the Influence of Religion"
    "Notably, t-test results also confirm this liberalization of attitudes as both Protestants and Catholics are in higher percentages of support than opposition."

    This reflects a shift over time towards more liberal views on marijuana even among traditionally conservative religious groups. It suggests a possible weakening in the direct influence of religious doctrine on opinions regarding marijuana legalization as societal norms evolve.

!!! quote "Role of Religiosity in Societal Attitudes"
    "The results of Model 1 are shown... religious salience (commitment) (-0.242, p < 0.001), religious service attendance (attachment) (-0.136, p < 0.001)... are negative, which indicates that the more a person conforms and bonds to religious activities, the less likely they are to support the legalization of marijuana."

    These findings align with the notion that religiosity functions as a form of social control, influencing individuals to conform to traditional norms that are typically against marijuana use and legalization.

!!! quote "Decreasing Influence of Religious Salience"
    "My results also indicate that religious salience and believing the Bible’s literalness as inspired word are no longer significant and impactful predictors on U.S. opinions towards marijuana legalization support."

    This may indicate a differentiation in the influence of various dimensions of religiosity on public opinion, suggesting that not all religious factors retain their impact over time, especially as society's general attitudes toward marijuana liberalize.

## Synthesis and Practical Implications
- Theological Synthesis: Bring together the discussions on the Church, Salvation, and Sabbath to form a coherent viewpoint on how Christians might view marijuana use.
- Practical Recommendations: Based on the theological synthesis, suggest how churches might approach the issue of marijuana, balancing compassion with ethical standards.
