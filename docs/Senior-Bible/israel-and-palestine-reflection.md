Read the following two articles from Sojourners - "Christian Leaders: Condemn Violence, Yet Urge for Justice for Palestine" and "What Christian Peace Building Looks Like in Israel & Palestine" and answer the following questions.

1. What do you know about the current situation unfolding in Israel & Palestine? What do you know historically about the conflict between Israel & Palestine?
2. What is your initial response after reading the articles or regarding what you have seen and read online about what is happening? How do you care for yourself if you feel overwhelmed by the news?
3. How do you respond to Christians (like Russell Moore) and plenty of others who are focusing squarely on the violence happening in Israel and not the occupation and violence that is happening in Palestine?
4. How do we confront Anti-Semitism when we see it or hear it from others when discussing this violent conflict?
5. Christians are called to be peacemakers. What does that role look like in this situation?
6. Respond to the following quote, "Despair is the luxury of the privileged." What does this mean to you? How do you hold hope and solidarity?

## Response
1. I know the conflict has been a historical issue, which was intertwined with religious and nationalistic claims to the territory. However, I don't really know too much about the details of why and what the conflict is specifically about.
2. I found this article slightly saddening, but it also allowed me to develop a more informed perspective about this conflict. I don't think I'm necessarily overwhelmed - rather more intrigued/understanding.
3. It's crucial to approach the Israel-Palestine conflict with nuance. Encouraging a broader understanding of both sides' historical and present contexts can promote more holistic solutions and mutual respect.
4. It's vital to challenge anti-Semitism whenever it arises. Distinguishing between valid criticism of policies and prejudiced views against Jews is essential. Education, dialogue, and standing with Jewish communities are key to countering this bigotry.
5. For Christians, being peacemakers in this context may mean promoting dialogue, reconciliation, and grassroots initiatives for peace. It involves standing against injustice and encouraging solutions respectful of all parties' rights and aspirations.
6. "Despair is the luxury of the privileged" implies that those with privilege can afford to feel despair without immediate repercussions. Maintaining hope and solidarity involves education, standing with the affected, and actively advocating for change.
