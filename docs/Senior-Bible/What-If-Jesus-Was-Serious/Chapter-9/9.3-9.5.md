# Pt. 9: 3-5

## Prompt

1. What is the most logical explanation for Jesus when it comes to His authority: crazy, criminal, or Christ?
2. How do you determine what and who has gravity in your life?
3. What if Jesus was serious? How does this question have the ability to change the course of our lives?

## Response

1. From a non-believer's perspective, considering Jesus as a historical figure with profound moral and philosophical teachings, He could be seen more as a revolutionary (rather than criminal) or a charismatic leader who genuinely believed in his message, rather than being "crazy."
2. What and who have gravity in my life are determined by their impact on my personal growth, values alignment, and the positive influence they have on my well-being and perspective.
3. If Jesus was serious, acknowledging the depth and sincerity of His teachings could challenge us to reevaluate our values and actions, potentially inspiring significant personal and ethical transformation.
