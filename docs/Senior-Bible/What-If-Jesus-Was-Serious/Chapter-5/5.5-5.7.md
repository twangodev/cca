# Pt. 5: 5-7

## Prompt

1. If we were to draw the connection between “daily bread” and “self-care” (although I don’t think they are necessarily the same thing), what do you need daily (outside of living necessities) to sustain you? What do you need to sustain you spiritually?
2. How does our longing for justice (and judgment for others) often blind us to the sins that need judgment or justice in ourselves?
3. Do you believe that God gives you more than you can handle? Is God the creator of temptation? How do we wrestle with the tension of knowing that temptation is inevitable and that we should flee from it while recognizing our human deficiencies and proclivity to sin? How can Hebrews 12.1-2 help us navigate this position?  

## Response

1. As a high school student, I need time each day for self-reflection and engaging in hobbies to maintain my mental and emotional health. Spiritually, practicing gratitude and acts of kindness helps sustain me, even with limited focus on religion.
2. Our desire for justice towards others can make us overlook our own faults; it's important to remember that self-reflection and acknowledging our own imperfections are crucial for personal growth.
3. I believe life's challenges can feel overwhelming, but they're not necessarily given by God; they're part of our growth journey. Hebrews 12:1-2 reminds us to focus on our core values and faith to navigate temptations and personal weaknesses.
