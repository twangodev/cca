# Pt 5: 1-2

## Prompt

1. What does “being seen” mean to you? How does that message affirm or challenge how you use social media?
2. How should we balance the privacy of our personal relationship with Christ with our call to publicly proclaim Jesus’s name?
3. Reflecting on the Lord’s Prayer (Our Father... Matt. 6.9-13), what stands out to you about the prayer that Jesus teaches the disciples? How can we keep a familiar and often repetitive prayer fresh and ripe with meaning in our personal prayer lives?

## Response

1. To me, "being seen" on social media is about being acknowledged and recognized by others - and sometimes it's going to be required for some form of social interaction. However, due to currently how the social media companies are modeled (data collection, advertisements, etc.) I'm not too keen on using them. I'd rather use more privacy-focused alternatives, like Signal or Telegram, for messaging, and maybe a blog or website for sharing my thoughts.
2. Since I'm not a believer, the idea of balancing privacy with proclaiming Jesus's name doesn't really apply to me. I prioritize privacy in general though in most parts of my life.
3. Looking at the Lord’s Prayer as someone who isn't religious, what stands out to me is its simplicity and the sense of community it fosters. To keep it meaningful for those who do believe, I guess it's about finding personal connections to the words and remembering the broader context in which Jesus shared it.
