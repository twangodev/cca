# Pt. 8: 1-3

## Prompt

1. How has your experience in Church/Christian settings discussed orthodoxy and orthopraxy? Which was emphasized more? Which one do we need to work on more?
2. What unpopular decisions have you made in your life? How did they lead to greater understanding of yourself or God?
3. How has popularity been an idol in your life?
4. What do you find appealing about taking the wide road? How does Jesus flip this idea on its head for us to navigate life?

## Response

1. In my experience, Church discussions have leaned more towards orthodoxy, emphasizing correct beliefs, though there's a growing recognition that we need to work more on orthopraxy, applying those beliefs in practical, daily actions.
2. Choosing to focus on my studies and personal projects over socializing was unpopular but helped me discover my passion for technology and self-learning. Sometimes it's alright to not take the road well-traveled.
3. Striving for popularity often made me overlook my true interests and hobbies, as I was too focused on what would make me "cool." This taught me that chasing approval can distract from discovering and valuing my own uniqueness.
4. The wide road is appealing because it promises easy rewards and acceptance, but Jesus's teachings suggest that true fulfillment comes from choosing paths that challenge us to be true to ourselves, even if they're less traveled.
