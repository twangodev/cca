# Essay: Doctrine, Dogma, and Society

In the contemporary Christian landscape, the interaction between established religious doctrines and current social issues offers a unique opportunity for discourse and development of ethical guidelines. The doctrines of the Church and Salvation, coupled with the traditional dogma of the Sabbath, provide a robust framework through which believers can explore and respond to modern challenges, including the debate over marijuana legalization. By integrating the doctrines of the Church and Salvation with the Sabbath dogma, Christians can formulate a principled yet compassionate stance on marijuana legalization, balancing ethical considerations with societal needs. This approach not only aligns with Christian moral imperatives but also addresses the practical realities faced by communities today.

The Church, both in its universal and local manifestations, plays a pivotal role in the lives of believers, shaping not only their spiritual but also ethical orientations. According to Heinrich Vogel, the Church's essence lies in the gathering of sanctified believers who engage in worship, sacraments, and Christian fellowship. This foundational aspect positions the Church to address societal issues such as marijuana legalization through a lens of faith and community values. Vogel underscores the importance of correct gospel teaching and sacramental practice as marks of the true Church, suggesting that the Church's stance on ethical issues should be grounded in doctrinal integrity and biblical truth. The dual aspect of the Church, both visible and invisible, allows it to navigate the complexities of societal issues without being confined to physical or legislative boundaries. This distinction is crucial when considering marijuana, as the Church can offer spiritual guidance that transcends legal debates, focusing instead on moral and ethical considerations that resonate with both individual believers and the wider community.

The mission of the Church, as Vogel articulates, is to preach the gospel to every creature, a directive that extends to how Christians interact with and influence societal issues, including the legalization of marijuana. This mission-oriented approach compels the Church to engage actively and educationally, rather than passively, in societal debates, promoting a message of wellness, stewardship of the body, and moral living that can influence discussions around marijuana use. The Church's responsibility is not to legislate but to educate and guide the faithful in making decisions that align with Christian values. This approach is particularly relevant in today's context where marijuana use is often debated not just on legal grounds but also for its health and ethical implications. Vogel's clear delineation between the roles of Church and state supports the idea that while the Church should not overstep into the domain of governance, it has a significant role in shaping the moral perspectives of its adherents, guiding them in matters of public morality and personal health.

In discussing the doctrine of Salvation, E. Edward Zinke emphasizes that Christian doctrine deepens the believer's faith, impacting their moral and ethical behaviors in profound ways. Salvation, which encompasses a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, informs and transforms the believer's interactions with the world, including their stance on contemporary issues like marijuana. Zinke's perspective on doctrines as bridges to deeper communion with God highlights how a robust theological framework can guide believers in navigating complex social issues. For instance, understanding the redemptive and sanctifying aspects of salvation might influence a believer's views on substances like marijuana, which could be seen as detrimental to one's spiritual and physical well-being. The integration of doctrine into everyday Christian life, as shown through the example of the Sabbath, which symbolizes rest and sanctification, provides a template for believers to measure their actions and lifestyle choices, ensuring they are in harmony with God's intentions for human flourishing and moral integrity.
The ongoing debates regarding marijuana legalization often intersect with issues of religious freedom, posing complex legal challenges that highlight the delicate balance between individual liberties and public safety. John T. Doyle points out the inherent conflicts that arise when religious practices, such as the sacramental use of substances like marijuana, clash with drug laws. The Supreme Court, in cases like Reynolds v. United States, has established a precedent that, while religious beliefs are absolutely protected, the practice of those beliefs can be regulated especially when they conflict with public safety or order. This legal framework forces a reevaluation of both religious freedom and drug policy, particularly in a diverse society where such practices may be integral to the religious life of minority communities. The necessity to define what constitutes a legitimate religious practice as opposed to a personal belief is crucial in this discourse, as it determines the extent to which religious practices can be accommodated within the law. This ongoing legal struggle underscores the need for policies that respect religious diversity without compromising the welfare of the broader public.

In the public health arena, marijuana's status continues to evolve as research sheds light on both its benefits and risks. James Goben highlights the significant medical applications of marijuana, which, according to experts like Dr. Sanjay Gupta, can sometimes be the only effective treatment for certain medical conditions. This medical perspective challenges traditional views on drug use, particularly within Christian ethics, where there is no explicit biblical prohibition against substances like marijuana. The comparison of marijuana to biblically endorsed substances like wine, which Paul recommends for health reasons, invites a reevaluation of its use under similar medicinal contexts. This analogy encourages a broader ethical consideration that balances compassion and healing with traditional moral concerns, reflecting a shift towards more nuanced interpretations of scripture in light of contemporary medical knowledge. As such, the Christian response to marijuana, especially in medicinal use, is increasingly framed by a combination of scriptural interpretation, cultural attitudes, and emerging medical evidence, illustrating the complex interplay between faith, health, and ethics.

The dialogue around marijuana legalization also involves significant ethical considerations that intersect with public health. As societal perceptions shift and the therapeutic benefits of marijuana become more recognized, the ethical debates within Christian communities intensify. The absence of direct biblical references to marijuana use forces a reliance on broader Christian principles such as the sanctity of the body, stewardship of one's health, and the alleviation of suffering to navigate this issue. These discussions are further complicated by the varying interpretations of scripture and the personal convictions of believers, highlighting the need for a compassionate approach that respects diverse viewpoints within the faith community. The challenge lies in distinguishing cultural biases from scriptural teachings, a task that requires thoughtful engagement with both the Bible and the changing realities of modern society. As such, the Christian response to marijuana is not only about navigating the legal and medical landscapes but also about engaging deeply with the theological and ethical dimensions that these issues evoke.

C.S. Lewis's insights into human nature and moral law offer a profound basis for understanding Christian responses to the legalization of marijuana. He argues that there exists a universal moral standard, an innate sense of right and wrong, which individuals across different cultures and religions implicitly understand. This perspective is crucial when evaluating the ethical implications of marijuana use, as it suggests that Christians are called to consider not only the legal aspects but also the deeper moral consequences of their actions. Lewis's emphasis on personal responsibility and the freedom to choose right from wrong aligns closely with the decisions Christians face regarding marijuana. If using or supporting the use of marijuana leads to beneficial outcomes such as medical relief or social justice, it might be viewed as consistent with Christian ethics. Conversely, if it results in harm or abuse, it would be contrary to the moral laws Christians aspire to uphold. This dual consideration of the universal moral law and the specific circumstances surrounding marijuana use challenges Christians to navigate their response thoughtfully, balancing compassion with adherence to ethical standards.

Lewis also discusses the concept of moral law as a preventative measure, which serves to maintain societal order and individual well-being. Applying this to the context of marijuana, Christians might argue that just as laws exist to prevent societal breakdown, moral laws guide individuals in making choices that promote communal and personal health. This view suggests that the legalization and use of marijuana should be approached with caution, ensuring that it does not lead to social discord or personal detriment. Furthermore, Lewis’s idea that morality involves harmonizing internal and external aspects of life encourages Christians to reflect on how their personal use of marijuana aligns with their spiritual and ethical convictions. This reflection should extend to considering the impact of marijuana on one’s health, relationships, and spiritual obligations, urging a holistic evaluation that considers all aspects of well-being.

Lastly, Lewis's notion of the purpose and direction of moral law underscores the importance of considering the broader implications of marijuana legalization on the general purpose of human life. For Christians, this involves pondering how marijuana use fits into God’s design for humanity and whether it enhances or hinders one’s ability to fulfill their God-given potential. The idea that morality aims to ensure fair play, tidy up internal conflicts, and align with one’s ultimate purpose provides a framework for Christians to assess the legalization of marijuana not just as a legal issue, but as a matter of personal and communal ethics. This approach compels the Christian community to think deeply about how their choices, including their stance on marijuana, reflect their core values and beliefs, and how these choices impact their witness to the world. Thus, integrating these ethical considerations with doctrinal beliefs and societal issues forms the crux of the Christian response to the complex issue of marijuana legalization.

The empirical findings presented by Jasmine M. Hernandez illustrate a significant correlation between levels of religiosity and attitudes towards marijuana legalization. Frequent religious service attendance and a literal interpretation of the Bible are strongly associated with opposition to marijuana legalization. This data suggests that deeply held religious beliefs significantly influence public opinion, particularly among communities that prioritize religious practices and doctrines. The implications of these findings are profound, as they highlight the role of religious institutions in shaping social norms and legal attitudes. Additionally, the study underlines the power of religious doctrine not just as a personal moral guide but also as a social influencer capable of affecting legislative outcomes. This relationship between religiosity and societal views on marijuana suggests that as religious adherence intensifies, so does resistance to marijuana legalization, emphasizing the church's potential role in advocacy and public policy discussions.

However, Hernandez also notes a shift over time, indicating a liberalization of attitudes towards marijuana among religious groups, a trend that could signal a weakening of the strict doctrinal stance against marijuana. This evolution in opinion may reflect broader societal changes and an increasing acceptance of marijuana, particularly for medical use. The study points out that both Protestants and Catholics have shown higher percentages of support over time, suggesting that traditional views on marijuana are being reconsidered in the light of new cultural and medical evidence. This shift could encourage religious leaders to reevaluate their positions, potentially leading to a more nuanced approach that distinguishes between recreational and medicinal uses of marijuana. It's crucial for the church to engage in ongoing dialogue about these issues, as failing to adapt to changing societal norms could risk alienating younger congregants who may view marijuana legalization more favorably.

Despite the noted liberalization, the overarching influence of religiosity on public opinions towards marijuana remains significant. The strong link between religious service attendance, belief in the literal interpretation of the Bible, and opposition to marijuana legalization highlights the enduring impact of religious beliefs on societal attitudes. These findings suggest that while the intensity of opposition may fluctuate, the foundational beliefs influencing these views remain robust among the religiously devout. For policymakers and religious leaders, understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing the complexities of marijuana legalization within a religious context. It also points to the necessity for churches to educate their congregations, not only about the doctrinal implications of marijuana use but also about the social, medical, and ethical considerations that must inform a balanced Christian perspective on its legalization.

The synthesis of the theological discussions around the Church, Salvation, and the Sabbath provides a comprehensive Christian viewpoint on marijuana use. The Church's dual nature, as discussed by Heinrich Vogel, emphasizes its role in guiding both the spiritual and societal actions of its followers, setting a stage for its response to marijuana legalization. By coupling this with the personal transformation and communal implications highlighted in the doctrine of Salvation, Christians are equipped to approach marijuana use not merely as a legal or social issue but as one deeply rooted in theological and ethical soil. This perspective is further enhanced by the dogma of the Sabbath, which introduces a rhythm of rest and reflection that could guide believers in considering the implications of marijuana use on their spiritual and physical well-being. Together, these doctrines encourage a response that is both informed by deep faith and sensitive to the complex realities of modern society, advocating for a stance that is not only principled but also compassionate and responsive to the evolving public discourse on marijuana.

From a practical standpoint, the Church can adopt several strategies to address the issue of marijuana within its communities effectively. First, fostering open and informed discussions that allow congregants to explore the ethical, medical, and legal facets of marijuana use within a safe and supportive environment is crucial. This could be facilitated through forums or study groups that engage with both scriptural teachings and contemporary research on marijuana. Additionally, the Church could develop resources such as position papers or guidelines that reflect a balanced view, considering the therapeutic benefits of marijuana alongside potential risks and ethical concerns. Outreach and education programs can also be implemented to address misconceptions and provide clear, compassionate guidance on how to approach marijuana use, particularly for medicinal purposes. This proactive approach ensures that the Church remains relevant and responsive to the needs of its members while upholding its doctrinal integrity and ethical standards.

Moreover, the Church has the opportunity to lead by example in the broader societal conversation about marijuana. By advocating for policies that reflect a nuanced understanding of marijuana's benefits and risks, the Church can influence public policy in a way that considers both individual well-being and community health. This could involve supporting research into the medicinal uses of marijuana or advocating for laws that protect against abuse while allowing for compassionate use. The Church's involvement in public advocacy can also extend to supporting initiatives that aim to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, especially when it is recommended for medical reasons. Through these efforts, the Church not only acts as a moral compass but also as a pragmatic leader in addressing one of the more contentious issues facing society today, demonstrating how faith and action can coexist in addressing complex modern challenges.

In conclusion, the intersection of Christian doctrines with contemporary societal issues like marijuana legalization provides a rich terrain for ethical exploration and practical engagement. By grounding their response in the foundational teachings of the Church, Salvation, and the Sabbath, Christians are uniquely positioned to offer insights that are both morally sound and empathetically attuned to the complexities of modern life. This approach allows for a holistic consideration that respects the spiritual, physical, and communal aspects of life, ensuring that the stance on marijuana is not merely reactive but deeply rooted in a well-considered theological framework. As the Church navigates these discussions, it must balance tradition with innovation, offering guidance that is both respectful of diverse perspectives and proactive in fostering an understanding that bridges faith and practical societal concerns. Through such thoughtful engagement, the Church not only upholds its moral imperatives but also contributes to a more nuanced and compassionate dialogue about marijuana within the wider community.
