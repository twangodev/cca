# Outline

## Introduction
Brief introduction to the doctrines of the Church and Salvation, the dogma of the Sabbath, and the issue of marijuana.

### Thesis Statement
By integrating the doctrines of the Church and Salvation with the Sabbath dogma, Christians can formulate a principled yet compassionate stance on marijuana legalization, balancing ethical considerations with societal needs.

## Theological Foundations

### Doctrine of the Church (Source: Heinrich Vogel)

Discuss the Church's universal and local roles, focusing on its mission and how it shapes its stance on ethical issues like marijuana.


!!! quote "Definition and Essence of the Church"
    "The church consists of sanctified believers in Christ... described as using the Word and the sacraments... They practice their faith, congregate for public worship, pray, and practice Christian fellowship" (Vogel).

    This quote encapsulates the core definition of the Church as a community of believers unified through faith and practice, which is foundational for discussing the Church's role in ethical issues like marijuana.

!!! quote "Marks of the Church"
    "Wherever the means of grace are in use, where the gospel is rightly taught and the sacraments are rightly administered, there the church must be present, since these are the means whereby believers are brought to faith" (Vogel).

    Vogel's emphasis on the correct teaching of the gospel and administration of sacraments as marks of the true Church is crucial for understanding how the Church maintains its doctrinal integrity and guides ethical behavior.

!!! quote "Invisible and Visible Aspects of the Church"
    "The church is invisible to man... We can only detect its presence by the profession of faith which believers make" (Vogel).

    The concept of the Church as both visible (in its congregations and practices) and invisible (in its spiritual communion) allows for a nuanced discussion of how the Church interacts with societal issues from a position that transcends physical or legislative boundaries.

!!! quote "Role and Mission of the Church"
    "The Lord has given his church one task to perform in the world, to 'go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature'" (Vogel).

    This directive is foundational for analyzing how the Church's mission impacts its stance on social issues like marijuana, emphasizing outreach and teaching as methods of influence.

!!! quote "Church and State Distinction"
    "The church and the state have entirely different tasks, engage in entirely different activities, and function with entirely different means" (Vogel).

    This distinction is vital for discussing how the Church should approach legal and ethical issues surrounding marijuana without overstepping its spiritual mandate.

- Church's Universal and Local Roles: Vogel's discussion highlights that the Church operates both universally (invisible church) and locally (visible congregations). In the context of marijuana, this dual role suggests that while the universal Church might guide overarching ethical standards, local congregations can address specific community needs and legal contexts.
- Ethical Guidance and Doctrinal Integrity: The Church's reliance on scripture and sacraments as marks of its true nature underscores its role in providing ethical guidance. This is particularly relevant in forming a response to marijuana use, where ethical and moral considerations are paramount.
- Mission-Oriented Approach: Vogel's emphasis on the Church's mission to preach the gospel implies that its approach to social issues should be proactive and educational, rather than merely reactive. In terms of marijuana, this could mean focusing on educational programs that align with Christian teachings about the body and mind.
- Navigating Church-State Relationships: By distinguishing the roles of Church and state, Vogel provides a framework for the Church to engage with social issues like marijuana legalization through advocacy and moral leadership without encroaching on governmental jurisdiction.

### Doctrine of Salvation (Source: E. Edward Zinke)

Present the role of doctrine in deepening faith and influencing moral behavior, crucial for understanding Christian behavior towards marijuana.

!!! quote "Essence and Goal of Christianity"
    "The sum of Christianity is to come to a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ... The goal of salvation is to enter into a full, rewarding, and mature fellowship with God and Jesus Christ that begins in the present and will last for eternity" (Zinke).

    This emphasizes that Christianity focuses on knowing God personally and that doctrines facilitate this deepening relationship.

!!! quote "Role of Doctrine in Christianity"
    "Doctrines are essential to our relationship with God, for they provide the information we need to enter into deeper communion with Him" (Zinke).

    Doctrine serves as a bridge to understanding and connecting with God, highlighting its importance in guiding moral and ethical behavior.

!!! quote "Integration of Doctrine and Christian Life"
    "A vital relationship exists between doctrine and Christian living... The Sabbath, for example, tells us that God is our Creator, our Redeemer, and the One who holds our future in His hands" (Zinke).

    This quote can be applied to the context of moral decisions regarding marijuana, showing how understanding and adhering to doctrines like the Sabbath can inform Christian ethical stances.

!!! quote "Doctrine as a Systematic Whole"
    "All biblical doctrines comprise a beautiful mosaic and must be viewed as a whole... We might be sitting in the same place, but the picture is not the same" (Zinke).

    This highlights the interconnectedness of doctrines and their collective impact on understanding God’s will and character, which is crucial for ethical decision-making.

- Deepening Faith Through Doctrine: Zinke's insights stress that salvation and doctrine are not mutually exclusive; rather, doctrine deepens understanding and faith, which are essential for fostering a righteous life. In the context of marijuana, this means that understanding doctrines can help Christians navigate the complexities of legal and ethical issues surrounding its use.
- Doctrine's Role in Moral Guidance: By explaining the integral role of doctrines like the Sabbath in defining our relationship with God, Zinke provides a framework for how Christians might view and respond to modern challenges such as marijuana use, emphasizing dependence on God's guidance rather than societal norms.
- Doctrine as a Comprehensive Framework: The idea that removing a single doctrine can alter the entire theological landscape parallels how understanding or misunderstanding one aspect of Christian teaching (like human freedom and responsibility) could affect attitudes towards marijuana. It underscores the importance of a holistic understanding of Christian doctrine in forming balanced and informed ethical views.
- Personal Relationship with God Through Doctrine: Zinke argues that doctrines are not merely theological positions but are essential for knowing God and His expectations. This personal relationship, informed by doctrine, guides believers in their daily choices and interactions, including those related to social and moral issues like marijuana usage.

### Dogma of the Sabbath (Source: V. Norskov Olsen)

Examine the foundational role of the Sabbath in Christian life, suggesting how it might inform lifestyle choices including the use of substances like marijuana.

!!! quote "The Sabbath as a Constitutive and Corrective Norm"
    Olsen describes the Sabbath as "a doctrine which at all times is a tuning fork, by which one can ascertain whether or not the other doctrines are in tune both on the spiritual and on the pragmatic levels" (Olsen).

    This concept emphasizes the Sabbath as a foundational principle that influences and aligns other Christian doctrines and behaviors, including lifestyle choices regarding health and substance use.

!!! quote "Sabbath and the Correct God-Concept"
    "The theology of the Sabbath restores the right God-concept: a transcendent God who is absolute, personal, and holy; the Creator and Sustainer of the universe" (Olsen).

    Olsen argues that the Sabbath reinforces the belief in a personal, creative God, counteracting modern atheistic and naturalistic trends. This concept can be pivotal in shaping views on marijuana, framing it within the context of creation and stewardship.

!!! quote "Sabbath as Reminder of Divine Action"
    "The weekly Sabbath is a reminder that God acts in history, and he sanctifies time and events taking place within history" (Olsen).

    The Sabbath, by highlighting God's active role in history, can influence how believers view time and their actions within it, including decisions about marijuana use in terms of legality, morality, and health.

- Role of the Sabbath in Ethical Decisions: Olsen's portrayal of the Sabbath as both a constitutive and corrective norm suggests it can serve as a moral compass. This is particularly relevant in making ethical decisions about marijuana, where considerations of health, legality, and personal discipline intersect with faith.
- Sabbath’s Influence on Lifestyle Choices: The idea that the Sabbath serves to remind believers of their creation in God's image and their purpose can directly impact lifestyle choices. For instance, the use of marijuana, whether for medical or recreational purposes, can be evaluated against Sabbath principles such as rest, reflection, and rejuvenation, as well as avoidance of any practice that might impair one's ability to honor God's creation.
- Integration of Sabbath Observance with Daily Living: Olsen's discussion about the Sabbath influencing not just spiritual but practical living underscores how this observance could guide actions throughout the week, including attitudes towards substances like marijuana. This might mean advocating for moderation, legality, and ethical sourcing, aligning with broader Sabbath values of justice and care for creation.

## Marijuana in Contemporary Society

### Historical and Legal Background (Source: John T. Doyle)

Outline the legal challenges and status of marijuana, linking religious freedom debates to current policy discussions.

!!! quote "Legal Challenges and Religious Freedom"
    "Several issues inevitably arise in the first amendment area. Can otherwise criminal activity be excused because it is claimed to be a religious practice?" This quote highlights the fundamental question at the heart of the debate between religious freedom and drug laws.

!!! quote "Supreme Court’s Stance"
    "A key dichotomy in free exercise analysis was established in 1872 in the case of Reynolds v. United States... The Supreme Court rejected his argument, saying: '[l]aws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.'"

    This establishes a precedent that while religious beliefs are protected absolutely, religious practices can be regulated.

!!! quote "State vs. Religious Practices"
    "Only those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion."

    This statement underscores the high threshold that must be met for the state to legally restrict religious practices, emphasizing the protected status of religious freedom under U.S. law.

- Interplay Between Drug Laws and Religious Freedom: The legal landscape surrounding the use of drugs for religious purposes is complicated by the need to balance individual religious freedoms with public health and safety concerns. The Supreme Court has set a precedent that while religious beliefs are inviolable, religious practices can be regulated, particularly if they pose a threat to public order or violate existing laws.
- Challenges in Defining Religious Practices: A significant challenge in cases like these is defining what constitutes a religious practice versus a belief and where the line should be drawn. This is crucial in determining whether specific actions protected under the guise of religious practice can supersede state laws, such as those regulating drug use.
- Implications for Policy Discussions: The ongoing legal battles and the precedents set by the courts influence current policy discussions on drug use and religious freedom. They prompt a reevaluation of existing laws to accommodate an increasingly pluralistic society where traditional drug use may be integral to religious ceremonies of minority cultures, such as those of Native Americans.
- Potential for Policy Reformation: The discussion points toward the possibility of reforming drug policies to better accommodate religious practices without compromising public safety. This involves recognizing religious practices involving drugs while also implementing strict regulations to prevent abuse.

### Public Health and Ethical Concerns (Source: James Goben)

Discuss the intersection of marijuana with public health and Christian ethical considerations.

!!! quote "Medical Benefits of Marijuana"
    "Marijuana doesn’t have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works." – Dr. Sanjay Gupta

    This quote highlights the recognition of marijuana's medical benefits, even by well-known medical professionals, which can alleviate symptoms in conditions where other medications might fail.

!!! quote "Biblical References and Ethical Considerations"
    "Perhaps it would be less of a volatile subject if Jesus had said, 'Thou shalt not smoke the wacky tobbacy' or if Paul had told Timothy to occasionally have a toke for his ailments."

    This playful hypothetical underscores the absence of direct biblical prohibitions against substances like marijuana, suggesting that ethical controversies surrounding its use might stem from cultural interpretations rather than explicit religious doctrines.

!!! quote "Paul's Advice on Medicinal Use of Wine"
    "Paul tells Timothy, 'Don’t continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.'"

    This scriptural reference is used to illustrate that the Bible acknowledges and condones the use of substances (in this case, wine) for their medicinal properties, potentially analogous to the use of medical marijuana today.

- Medical Perspective on Marijuana: The acknowledgment of marijuana's medical applications by authorities like Dr. Gupta supports the argument that marijuana can play a beneficial role in healthcare. Its ability to treat symptoms not alleviable by other treatments makes it a critical option in palliative care, particularly for chemotherapy patients and those with chronic pain or neurological disorders.
- Christian Ethical Considerations: The article explores the ethical implications of marijuana use within a Christian context, noting the lack of specific biblical directives regarding such modern issues. This absence suggests that ethical debates on marijuana may need to consider broader Christian principles such as compassion, healing, and the alleviation of suffering rather than looking for direct prohibitions or endorsements.
- Biblical Analogy with Wine: By comparing marijuana to wine, which is biblically endorsed for medicinal use, the article opens a discussion on the potential acceptance of marijuana if viewed through a similar lens. This comparison challenges Christian communities to reevaluate their stance on marijuana, particularly in contexts where it is used to relieve suffering.
- Cultural vs. Scriptural Prohibitions: The discussion suggests that much of the opposition to marijuana might be culturally rather than scripturally based. This distinction is crucial for communities interpreting ancient texts to guide modern life, emphasizing the need to distinguish between cultural biases and religious teachings.
- Navigating Convictions and Commands: The article touches on the importance of distinguishing between personal convictions and scriptural commands. This distinction is vital in discussions about marijuana, where personal beliefs about its use can vary widely. Emphasizing this could lead to a more tolerant and nuanced approach within the Christian community towards those who use marijuana, particularly for medicinal purposes.
