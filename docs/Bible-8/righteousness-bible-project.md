## Given Verses:

!!! quote "Deuteronomy: 32:4 NIV"

    He is the Rock, his works are perfect,<br/>
    and all his ways are just.<br/>
    A faithful God who does no wrong,<br/>
    upright and just is he.<br/>

Impact on our Lives: This verse shows that God is perfect and since he is perfect he is always just, and always sees the truth. Meaning God sees all of our wrongdoings and still loves us. He also always never has bad judgement, meaning if he throws an obstacle our way he’s only doing it for a reason, because he never makes mistakes.

!!! quote "Isaiah: 45:20-25 NIV"

    20 “Gather together and come;<br/>
    assemble, you fugitives from the nations.<br/>
    Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood,<br/>
    who pray to gods that cannot save.<br/>
    21 Declare what is to be, present it—<br/>
    let them take counsel together.<br/>
    Who foretold this long ago,<br/>
    who declared it from the distant past?<br/>
    Was it not I, the Lord?<br/>
    And there is no God apart from me,<br/>
    a righteous God and a Savior;<br/>
    there is none but me.<br/>
    22 “Turn to me and be saved,<br/>
    all you ends of the earth;<br/>
    for I am God, and there is no other.<br/>
    23 By myself I have sworn,<br/>
    my mouth has uttered in all integrity<br/>
    a word that will not be revoked:<br/>
    Before me every knee will bow;<br/>
    by me every tongue will swear.<br/>
    24 They will say of me, ‘In the Lord alone<br/>
    are deliverance and strength.’”<br/>
    All who have raged against him<br/>
    will come to him and be put to shame.<br/>
    25 But all the descendants of Israel<br/>
    will find deliverance in the Lord<br/>
    and will make their boast in him.<br/>

Impact: This verse had a very powerful impact on our lives, it calls people to be Christians to follow their God and worship. It calls them to cast down their wooden idols and worship their one true saviour in a powerful display of meaningful words and prophecies of greatness.

!!! quote "Psalm: 111:1-3 NIV"

    1 Praise the Lord.[b]<br/>
    I will extol the Lord with all my heart<br/>
    in the council of the upright and in the assembly.<br/>
    2 Great are the works of the Lord;<br/>
    they are pondered by all who delight in them.<br/>
    3 Glorious and majestic are his deeds,<br/>
    and his righteousness endures forever.<br/>
    Impact on our Lives: This verse explains that God is righteous, so as we live our lives, we can be reassured that God is righteous. This means he's basically perfect.<br/>

!!! quote "2nd Corinthians: 5:21 NIV"

    God made him who had no sin to be sin[a] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

Explanation:  I think this shows that even though we try to cover our mistakes, there is no hiding from God, and because of that we should try and do more good. Because God is always watching and only knows the truth.

Righteousness Definition: It is impossible for him to do or cause anything that is wrong
