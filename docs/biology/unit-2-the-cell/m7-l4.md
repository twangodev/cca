## Response

1. **List and describe** the types of cellular transport

    There are mainly three types of cellular transport: passive transport, active transport, and bulk transport. Passive transport requires no energy and includes processes like diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport requires energy to move substances against their concentration gradient and includes primary and secondary active transport. Bulk transport involves the movement of large particles or groups of molecules through processes like endocytosis and exocytosis.

2. **Explain** the role of the cell membrane during passive transport and active transport

    In passive transport, the cell membrane allows specific molecules to pass through via diffusion or facilitated diffusion, maintaining the cell’s internal environment. In active transport, the cell membrane utilizes protein pumps and spends energy to move substances from areas of low concentration to high concentration. The cell membrane thus plays a crucial role in regulating the entry and exit of substances, ensuring the cell’s proper functioning.

3. **Sketch** a before and an after diagram of an animal cell placed in a hypertonic solution

    Initially, an animal cell in a hypertonic solution will be full and round. After being placed in a hypertonic solution, water will move out of the cell due to osmosis, causing the cell to shrink and potentially become crenated. This change illustrates the effect of osmotic pressure on cells in different tonicity environments.

4. **Contrast** how facilitated diffusion is different from active transport.

    Facilitated diffusion relies on protein channels or carriers to move substances down their concentration gradient without using energy. In contrast, active transport uses energy, often in the form of ATP, to move substances against their concentration gradient through protein pumps. Therefore, while facilitated diffusion is a passive process, active transport is an energy-consuming active process.

5. **Describe** some organisms that normally live in pond water contain water pumps. These pumps continually pump water out of the cell. Describe a scenario that might reverse the action of the pump.

    Some microorganisms in pond water have specialized pumps to continually expel excess water, maintaining their internal environment. If the pond water becomes highly concentrated with solutes (hypertonic), it might reverse the action of these pumps to allow water to flow into the cell. This adaptation would help prevent the cell from losing too much water and becoming dehydrated.
