*Q7: Using the Cell Theory, is a virus a cell or not a cell? Explain.

## Response

1. **Describe** the cell theory

    The cell theory is a foundational principle in biology, positing that all living organisms are made up of cells, the cell is the smallest unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. These concepts highlight the integral role of cells in life and biological processes. The theory has been developed and refined over time through extensive research and microscopic observations.

2. **Describe** how you would determine whether the cells of a newly discovered organism were prokaryotic or eukaryotic

    To identify if a newly discovered organismâ€™s cells are prokaryotic or eukaryotic, you would examine them under a microscope. Prokaryotic cells are simpler, lacking a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotic cells have these complex structures. Observing the cell size, presence of a nucleus, and types of organelles can guide this determination. Additional molecular techniques like DNA sequencing can also provide insights.

3. **Math Connection:** If the overall magnification of a series of two lenses is 30x, and one lens magnifies 5x, what is the magnification of the other lens? Calculate the total magnification if the 5x lens is replaced by a 7x lens.

    The total magnification of a series of lenses is found by multiplying the magnifications of the individual lenses. If one lens magnifies 5x and the total magnification is 30x, the other lens must magnify 6x (since 5x * 6x = 30x). If the 5x lens is replaced by a 7x lens, the new total magnification would be 42x (7x * 6x = 42x).

4. Using the Cell Theory, is a virus a cell or not a cell? Explain.

    Viruses are not considered cells and do not fit within the cell theory framework. They lack the cellular structure and functions associated with life, such as metabolism and growth. Viruses require a host cell to replicate, further distinguishing them from cellular life forms.
