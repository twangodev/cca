## Response

1. **Describe** the process that breaks down food so that nutrients can be absorbed by the body

    Food digestion begins with ingestion and mechanical breakdown in the mouth, aided by enzymes in saliva. In the stomach, food is further broken down by acid and enzymes. The small intestine is where most chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occur, with the help of enzymes and bile. Undigested matter is moved to the large intestine for water absorption, and waste is eventually excreted.

2. **Analyze** the differences between mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Explain why chemical digestion is necessary for the body.

    Mechanical digestion involves physical breakdown of food, increasing surface area for enzymes to act upon. Chemical digestion involves enzymes and acids breaking food down into absorbable nutrients. Chemical digestion is crucial as it transforms complex food molecules into simpler forms that can be absorbed and utilized by the body.

3. **Analyze** what the consequences might be if the lining of the small intestine were completely smooth instead of having villi

    A smooth small intestine lining would significantly reduce surface area, impeding nutrient absorption. This could lead to malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies. The efficiency of the digestive process would also be compromised.

4. **Explain** why the pH in the digestive system changes from the mouth, to the stomach, and to the intestine. (Hint: consider enzymes)

    The pH in the digestive system changes to optimize enzyme activity. A slightly acidic pH in the mouth aids carbohydrate breakdown. The stomachâ€™s highly acidic environment activates protein-digesting enzymes and kills pathogens. The small intestine has a neutral pH, suitable for various digestive enzymes.

5. **Identify** an issue that would occur for each of the digestive organs if it is not functioning correctly: stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine.

    Stomach issues can cause pain and indigestion. Liver dysfunction can lead to toxin buildup and digestion issues. Gallbladder issues can impair fat digestion. Pancreatic dysfunction can cause malabsorption and diabetes. Small intestine issues can lead to malabsorption and deficiencies. Large intestine problems can result in digestive discomfort and irregular bowel movements.
