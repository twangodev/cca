## Response

1. Describe the difference between white rice and brown rice in terms of the type of carbohydrates.

    White rice and brown rice differ in their carbohydrate content and type. Brown rice is a whole grain, retaining its bran and germ, providing complex carbohydrates and fiber, leading to slower digestion and steadier blood sugar levels. White rice, on the other hand, has the bran and germ removed, leaving mostly starchy endosperm, which results in quicker digestion and potential blood sugar spikes. The fiber in brown rice also contributes to a feeling of fullness and can aid in digestive health.

2. Your friend, Jessie, told you that any type of fat is bad and that you should replace the fat in your diet with carbohydrates instead. How would you respond to her?

    It's crucial to explain to Jessie that not all fats are harmful, and including healthy fats in our diet is essential. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in fish, nuts, and certain oils, promote heart health and reduce bad cholesterol levels. Completely replacing fats with carbohydrates, especially refined carbs, can lead to negative health effects. A balanced diet with a variety of nutrients is key to overall health.

3. Choose a vitamin/mineral and summarize the effects of its deficiency.

    Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone health, immune function, and regulating inflammation. Deficiency in this vitamin can lead to weakened bones, increased susceptibility to infections, and potential chronic diseases. Obtaining Vitamin D from sunlight, diet, and supplements is vital, especially in regions with limited sunlight exposure. Ensuring adequate Vitamin D levels supports overall health and wellbeing.
