## Response
1. **Explain** why sustaining biodiversity is essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth.

   Biodiversity represents the range of life on Earth, from genes to ecosystems. It ensures ecosystem resilience, enabling them to recover from disturbances. Without biodiversity, ecosystems would be less resilient, and many essential services that humans rely on, such as clean water and food, would be at risk.

2. **Generalize** why maintaining biodiversity has a direct economic value to humans.

   Biodiversity provides essential resources for industries like agriculture, medicine, and tourism. It ensures food security through varied crops and offers potential sources for new medicines. Plus, biodiverse regions often attract tourism, generating significant revenue.

3. **Evaluate and discuss** the importance of maintaining biodiversity for future medical needs.

   Many current medicines originate from natural sources, and unexplored biodiversity could provide treatments for future health challenges. Losing biodiversity may mean losing potential life-saving drugs. Thus, conserving biodiversity is pivotal for medical advancements.
