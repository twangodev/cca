# 16 - The Media: New technologies, Enduring Issues

## The Evolving News Media

### Introduction
- The news media have significantly influenced American political culture and public attitudes toward government and politics since before the nation's founding.
- As a linkage institution, the media facilitates communication between citizens and government, shaped extensively by technological advancements.

### The Print Media and a New Nation
- During the late 1780s, newspapers emerged as a prominent force in American political life, particularly highlighted by their role in the debates over the Constitution’s ratification.

### Freedom of the Press and the Ratification Debates
- The press was instrumental in the ratification debates of the Constitution, with essays and editorials prolifically contributed under pseudonyms.
- The First Amendment, promising press freedom, became a cornerstone of American democracy, crucial for the ratification of the Constitution.

### The Media Goes "Mass"
- **Penny Presses**: Newspapers became more accessible in the 1830s with the advent of the penny press, drastically reducing costs and expanding readership.
- **Partisanship and Scandal**: Newspapers often focused on sensational stories to boost sales and attract advertisers.

### Journalists as Investigators and Activists
- **Investigative Journalism**: Emerged in the nineteenth century, transforming journalists into detectives who sought to uncover malfeasance and influence public opinion, especially during the Progressive Era with the rise of muckrakers.

### Direct to Americans’ Homes: Radio and Television
- **Broadcast Media**: Radio and television brought political figures and events directly into American homes, making political news a more immediate and shared experience.
- **Influence of Television**: The first televised presidential debates in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon illustrated the powerful visual impact of television on public perception.

### Media Evolution in the Late 20th Century
- **Partisan Shifts**: The 1980s saw a marked change with media targeting narrower audiences, leading to increased polarization.
- **Cable News**: CNN and Fox News epitomized the shift towards 24-hour news cycles and partisan coverage.

### New Media: New Freedom and New Problems
- **Digital Platforms**: The internet and digital media have further diversified how news is consumed and produced, enabling users to function as journalists and commentators.
- **Polarization Concerns**: Despite the increased accessibility of information, the ideological leanings of news sources may intensify political polarization.

## Public Policy Regulating Content and Ownership

### Introduction to Media Regulation
- The government regulates the media focusing primarily on content and ownership to balance freedom of the press with the need to maintain liberty and order.

### The Changing Nature of Regulation

#### Early Regulations
- **Radio Act of 1927**: Introduced licensing for broadcasters to manage frequency use.
- **Communications Act of 1934**: Established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to oversee broadcast media, enhancing governmental oversight.

#### Supreme Court and Media Freedom
- **New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)**: Affirmed that the government could not preemptively censor publications unless national security was at risk, reinforcing the press's role in a democratic society.

#### Modern Challenges
- The rise of the internet and social media has complicated the regulation of content due to the First Amendment protections of free expression.

### Public Policy and Media Consolidation

#### Historical Context
- Initially, regulations prevented excessive media consolidation to ensure a diversity of viewpoints and maintain a healthy democratic public discourse.

#### Changes in Regulation
- **1980s Deregulation**: Initiated under FCC Chairman Mark Fowler, who advocated for fewer regulations on media ownership.
- **Telecommunications Act of 1996**: Allowed significant media consolidation by increasing the audience reach limits and the number of media outlets a single entity could own.

#### Effects of Consolidation
- **Media Consolidation**: Defined as the concentration of media ownership by fewer corporations, affecting the diversity of information and viewpoints.
- **Impact on News Reporting**: Corporate decisions often dictate news coverage, potentially skewing the public agenda and underreporting critical issues like human rights and climate change.

#### Legal and Political Developments
- **Net Neutrality**: Debated extensively, with policies fluctuating between administrations. The Obama era FCC supported net neutrality to ensure equal internet access, but it was later repealed during the Trump administration.

## How the Media Shape American Politics Today

### The Political Perils of the New Media
- **Rise of Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow direct communication from politicians to citizens, vastly changing the dynamics of public engagement.
- **Constant Surveillance**: Politicians must navigate a world where any remark can be instantly publicized through social media, increasing the stakes of every public appearance.

### The New Media and the Reshaping of What Is News
- **Infotainment**: News outlets blend information with entertainment to attract viewers, often at the cost of diluting the focus on significant political and economic issues.
- **Impact on Public Perception**: Shows like *The Daily Show* may increase political awareness but also foster cynicism towards government institutions.

### Bias and Coverage of the News
- **Perceived Partisan Bias**: There's a growing perception of partisan bias in media, influenced by the political leanings of journalists and the stories covered by media outlets.
- **Decline in Trust**: Confidence in traditional news sources, especially TV news, has significantly declined, influenced by accusations of bias and sensationalism.

### The Media as Shapers of Political Campaigns and Elections
- **Horse-Race Journalism**: Media often focuses more on the competitive aspects of campaigns rather than substantive policy issues, affecting public perception of elections.
- **Control of the Message**: Politicians and campaigns actively manage media interactions to shape public reception of their messages, often limiting access to control narratives.

### A Digital Divide?
- **Inequality in Media Access**: The proliferation of digital media creates disparities in political engagement and knowledge, with those less digitally savvy at a disadvantage.
- **Digital Divide**: Demographic factors such as age, income, and education level influence the extent to which different groups engage with digital media, potentially widening gaps in political knowledge and participation.

### A Credibility Divide?
- **Navigating Media Credibility**: The abundance of sources, including satirical and citizen journalism, complicates the ability of individuals to discern reliable news, necessitating a critical approach to media consumption.
- **Responsibility of the Public**: There's an increased need for critical media literacy among citizens to maintain an informed electorate in a democracy.
