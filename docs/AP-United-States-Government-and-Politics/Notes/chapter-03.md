# 3 - Federalism: Dividing Power between the National Government adn the States

## Conflict Over Medical Marijuana

### Background
- **Lawsuit Filed**: Angel McClary Raich and Diane Monson filed lawsuits against the U.S. government in a California federal court in 2002.
- **Central Argument**: Their use of medical marijuana, legal under California law but illegal under federal law, was claimed to be protected by state law and the U.S. Constitution.
- **Health Issues**:
    - **Raich**: Inoperable brain tumor, seizures, endometriosis, scoliosis, wasting disorder. Claimed marijuana was essential for survival.
    - **Monson**: Chronic back pain and spasms. Grew her own marijuana plants.

### Legal Context
- **California Law**: Compassionate Use Act of 1996, legalizing medical marijuana under physician supervision.
- **Federal Law**: Controlled Substances Act of 1970, classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug, illegal for use and cultivation.

### The Conflict
- **State vs. Federal Law**: Raich and Monson caught in a legal clash between California and federal laws.
- **Federal Intervention**: In 2002, DEA agents seized and destroyed Monson's marijuana plants despite compliance with state law.
- **Allegations**: Monson accused the DEA of violating her civil rights and California law.

### Wider Implications
- **State-Level Changes**: Many states reducing penalties, legalizing medical/recreational marijuana, establishing dispensaries.
- **Tension with Federal Power**: State actions in contrast with Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.

### Legal Proceedings
- **Appeals Court Ruling**: Initially ruled in favor of Raich and Monson.
- **Supreme Court Involvement**:
    - **Appeal by U.S. Attorney General**: Alberto Gonzales appealed the ruling.
    - **Central Issues**: Whether the Controlled Substances Act overrides California's medical marijuana law; boundary between federal and state powers.

## Federalism and the Constitution

### Systems of Government

#### Types of Government Systems
- **Unitary System**: Central government holds primary power, can delegate to subnational governments.
- **Confederal System**: Subnational governments (states) hold more power than the national government.
- **Federal System**: Power divided between states and the national government, each having exclusive powers.

#### Examples
- **Unitary**: United Kingdom, China, Iran.
- **Confederal**: Historical U.S. under Articles of Confederation, Switzerland.
- **Federal**: Modern U.S., Mexico, Nigeria, Russia.

### National and State Powers

#### Enumerated or Expressed Powers
- Powers explicitly granted to the national government by the Constitution.

#### Exclusive Powers
- Powers only the national government may exercise.

#### Implied Powers
- Powers not specifically granted but necessary to execute enumerated powers.

#### Powers Denied to the National Government
- Restrictions include prohibition of bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and suspension of habeas corpus.

### Key Constitutional Clauses

#### Commerce Clause
- Authorizes Congress to regulate interstate and international commerce.

#### Necessary and Proper Clause
- Grants federal government authority to pass laws essential for executing its powers.

#### Supremacy Clause
- Establishes the Constitution and federal laws as the supreme law of the land.

### Powers of State Governments

#### Tenth Amendment
- Reserves powers not delegated to the national government for the states and the people.

#### Reserved Powers
- Powers retained by the states, including police powers and authority over local governance.

#### Concurrent Powers
- Powers shared by both national and state governments, like taxation and borrowing money.

### Regional and Local Governments
- Local governments are subject to state authority and can be restructured by states.

### Relationships between States

#### Article IV Provisions
- **Full Faith and Credit Clause**: States must recognize public acts, records, and civil court proceedings of other states.
- **Extradition**: States are required to return individuals accused of crimes to the state where the crime was committed.
- **Privileges and Immunities Clause**: Prevents states from discriminating against citizens of other states.

## The Dynamic Nature of Federalism

### Evolution of Federalism
- **Dynamic Process**: Federalism evolves through political processes, influencing the power balance between national and state governments.
- **Influential Figures**: John Marshall, Chief Justice from 1801-1835, significantly shaped American federalism.

### Analyzing Supreme Court Cases
- **Approach**: Understanding the context, identifying constitutional issues, analyzing decisions, and considering implications.

### The Marshall Court: Expanding National Power
- **McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**: Affirmed the national government's authority to establish a national bank and disallowed states from taxing it.
- **Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)**: Strengthened Congress's power under the commerce clause, regulating interstate commerce.

### Post-Civil War Amendments
- **Thirteenth Amendment**: Outlawed slavery.
- **Fourteenth Amendment**: Provided citizenship, equal protection, and due process, limiting state power.
- **Fifteenth Amendment**: Gave African American males the right to vote.

### Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
- Upheld racial segregation under the “separate but equal” doctrine, asserting states’ rights.

### Transition from Dual to Cooperative Federalism
- **Dual Federalism**: Distinct, separate operation of state and national governments.
- **Cooperative Federalism**: Both levels of government work together on policy-making.

### The Great Depression and Federalism
- **Impact of the Depression**: Strained state resources, leading to increased national government intervention.
- **Roosevelt's New Deal**: Significantly expanded national government's role, especially in commerce regulation.
- **Social Security Act of 1935**: Example of cooperative federalism, establishing federal programs for social welfare.

## The Supreme Court and Modern Federalism

### United States v. Lopez (1995)
- **Background**: Alfonso Lopez Jr. charged under the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for carrying a gun in a school zone.
- **Legal Issue**: Whether Congress exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause.
- **Supreme Court Decision**: The Act was unconstitutional as carrying a gun in a school zone was not an economic activity affecting interstate commerce.
- **Significance**: This decision limited federal power, emphasizing the Tenth Amendment and states’ authority.

### Key Terms
- **Tenth Amendment**: Asserts states' rights and powers not delegated to the federal government.
- **Commerce Clause**: Grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.

### Same-Sex Marriage and Federalism
- **United States v. Windsor (2013)**: Overturned the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) section that defined marriage federally as between opposite-sex couples.
- **Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)**: Legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, recognizing it as a fundamental right.
- **States’ Rights vs. Civil Rights**: These cases highlight the tension between states' rights and national protection of civil rights.

- **Background**: Challenge against the Controlled Substances Act's ban on medical marijuana, conflicting with California law.
- **Supreme Court Decision**: Upheld federal law, ruling that marijuana production and use impact interstate commerce.
- **Outcome**: Reasserted federal power over state laws in regulating controlled substances.

### Federal vs. State Marijuana Laws
- **Conflicting Laws**: States have varying laws on medical and recreational marijuana use, conflicting with federal law.
- **Enforcement Challenges**: Federal enforcement is complicated due to widespread state-level legalization or decriminalization.

### Evolving Federalism
- **Continued Debate**: The balance of power between federal and state governments remains a dynamic and contested aspect of American federalism.
- **Unresolved Questions**: How to reconcile state compliance with conflicting federal laws continues to challenge the federal system.
