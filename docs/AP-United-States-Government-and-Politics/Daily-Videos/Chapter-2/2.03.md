# 3: Congressional Behavior

## Understanding the Role and Models of Representation

Representatives play a crucial role in democracy by acting on behalf of their constituents. Their responsibilities include:

- **Voting on legislation**
- Assisting constituents in navigating government services
- Acting on complaints regarding federal services
- Sponsoring constituents for scholarships or government contracts
- Gathering suggestions on improving government operations

### Models of Representation

Representatives adopt different approaches to reflect their constituents' needs and preferences:

#### Delegate Model

In this model, representatives act strictly according to the wishes of their constituents. For example, a representative might advocate for more financial resources for a rural hospital if that's a pressing concern among their constituents.

#### Trustee Model

Representatives use their judgment to make decisions, potentially even against a majority preference of their constituents, if they believe it serves the greater good. An instance of this could be opposing popular tax cuts due to the belief that they would harm the nation's economy.

#### Politico Model

This approach combines elements of both the Delegate and Trustee models. Legislators rely on their judgment but shift to prioritizing constituent preferences when public opinion is strong on a particular issue.

### Divided Governments and Partisanship

Partisanship within Congress can lead to gridlocks, where legislative progress stalls due to ideological differences. Overcoming these requires negotiation and compromise. Elections may result in divided government, challenging the alignment between the presidency and Congress, leading to legislative standstills and opposition against presidential initiatives.

### Gerrymandering and Its Impact

Gerrymandering, malapportionment, and unequal representation have caused imbalances in political power. Landmark cases like **Baker v. Carr** (1962) and **Shaw v. Reno** (1993) have addressed these issues:

- **Baker v. Carr** established the "one person, one vote" principle, ensuring equal population distribution across districts.
- **Shaw v. Reno** ruled against racial gerrymandering, stating race cannot be the predominant factor in redistricting, except to comply with the Voting Rights Act.
