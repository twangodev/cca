# 2 - Voter Turnout

## State and Federal Laws Impacting Voter Turnout

- **State and Federal Balance**: States have significant power in setting election rules, but the federal government also influences through laws and enforcement of voting rights.
- **National vs. State-Controlled Elections**: National elections often see higher turnout due to greater media coverage and public interest compared to state-controlled elections.

## Voter Registration Laws and Their Impact

### Factors Influencing Voter Registration:
1. **Registration Deadlines**: Strict deadlines can lower turnout; same-day registration tends to increase participation.
2. **Voter ID Requirements**: States requiring photo ID might see lower turnout, especially among marginalized groups.
3. **Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)**: States with AVR generally experience higher turnout due to ease of registration.
4. **Online Registration**: Availability of online registration correlates with higher voter turnout.

## Incentives and Penalties

- **Voting Incentives**: Includes monetary rewards, time off work, and other benefits that can increase turnout.
- **Penalties and Fines**: These can compel voting but may also be viewed as coercive and impact the perceived legitimacy of elections.

## Election Types and Turnout

- **Midterm vs. Presidential Elections**: Turnout is significantly higher in presidential elections due to the higher stakes and greater public attention.

## Factors Influencing Voter Choice

- **Political Efficacy**: Belief in the effectiveness of one's vote is a crucial motivator for voter turnout.
- **Ideological Orientation**: Strong political alignments (progressive or conservative) often drive higher voter engagement.
- **Candidate Characteristics**: Campaigns that highlight appealing candidate traits can motivate voter turnout.
- **Contemporary Issues**: Current political and social issues significantly impact voter interest and turnout.

## Demographic Influences on Voting
