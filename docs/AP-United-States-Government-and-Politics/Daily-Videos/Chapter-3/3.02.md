# 2: First Amendment Freedom of Religion

## Focus on Freedom of Religion

### Protection under the First Amendment
- Ensures individuals can practice their religion freely or choose not to practice any religion, without government retribution.
- Not absolute; balanced against other societal interests.

### Key Supreme Court Cases
- **Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972):** Compulsory high school attendance was ruled to violate the Amish community's free exercise of religion.
- **Reynolds v. United States (1878):** Upheld federal regulation of marriage, specifically against polygamy, but did not extend to regulating religious beliefs.

### Establishment Clause
- Prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or preferring one religion over another.
- Supports the separation of church and state.
- Exceptions have included government subsidies for schools with general religious education.

## Other Key Freedoms in the First Amendment

### Freedom of Speech
- Protects the right to express opinions, fostering a functioning democracy.

### Freedom of the Press
- Allows for free dissemination of information, enabling the press to report on issues and act as a watchdog.

### Peaceful Assembly
- Enables individuals to gather and express opinions, essential for effecting change.

### Petitioning the Government
- Allows for voicing complaints and seeking redress, holding the government accountable.

## The Lemon Test
- A three-part test to determine if a government action violates the Establishment Clause:
    1. Must have a secular purpose.
    2. Should not advance or inhibit religion.
    3. Must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.

## Illustrative Supreme Court Cases

### Engel v. Vitale (1962)
- Addressed school sponsorship of religious activities, ruling that school prayer violated the Establishment Clause.

### Yoder Case Revisited
