# Brown vs. Board of Education

## Background
- **Name of the Case:** Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka
- **Year Decided:** 1954
- **Facts:** The case originated when several black children were denied admission to certain public schools based on laws allowing public education to be segregated by race.
- **Issue:** The core issue was whether the segregation of public education based solely on race violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
- **Decision** The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that racial segregation of children in public schools was unconstitutional.
- **Majority Decision Reasoning:** The Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, found that segregation in public education created a sense of inferiority amongst African-American children that could affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. This was fundamentally at odds with the Equal Protection Clause.
- **Dissenting Opinion Reasoning:** There was no dissenting opinion in this case; the decision was unanimous.
- **Impact of the Case:** This landmark decision declared the "separate but equal" doctrine, established by the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, to be unconstitutional in the context of public education. It marked the beginning of the end for racial segregation in U.S. schools and became a cornerstone for the civil rights movement.

## Questions

- What factors should a court consider in determining whether or not schools are "equal?"

    Courts should consider various factors, including the quality of facilities, access to resources (books, technology, etc.), teacher qualifications, funding levels, extracurricular opportunities, and the psychological impact of segregation on students.

- Explain why the Supreme Court ordered African American students to be admitted to white schools in the Delaware case.

    The Supreme Court ordered the admission of African American students to white schools because the lower courts found that the black schools were inferior in terms of teacher salary, teacher qualification, and condition of school plant and equipment. This showed a clear disparity in educational quality, which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.

- What factors, other than history, should the Supreme Court consider in determining the meaning of an amendment and how to apply it?

    Beyond history, the Supreme Court should consider the amendment's purpose, societal changes and expectations, precedents, the amendment's text, and its implications for justice and equality in contemporary society.

- Why didn't the court have a relevant separate but equal doctrine in cases involving Graduate School?

    In cases involving graduate education, the Court found that intangible factors, such as the professional and academic network, the prestige of the institution, and the quality of education, could not be equalized by simply providing separate facilities. The unique and individualized nature of graduate education made it impossible to achieve equality under a segregated system.

- Explain how the court determines the effects of segregation on students?

    The Court relies on psychological studies, educational research, and testimonies to understand the detrimental effects of segregation. This includes impacts on self-esteem, development of racial biases, and creating a sense of inferiority among minority children.

- This passage emphasizes the fact that education has traditionally been a state and local issue. Under what circumstances should the Supreme Court become involved in state and local laws concerning education.

    The Supreme Court should become involved when state and local laws concerning education violate fundamental rights or constitutional protections, such as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

- How did legal segregation impact intangible considerations such as the ability to study or engage in conversation?

    Legal segregation impacts intangible considerations by creating environments that can diminish students' motivation and ability to learn, hinder social development, and perpetuate a system of racial inferiority and superiority.

- Why is it crucial for the court to consider the impact of segregation on younger students?

    It's crucial to consider the impact of segregation on younger students because early education is foundational. Negative experiences at this stage can have long-lasting effects on a child's educational and social development, reinforcing societal divisions.

- Courts are often reluctant to overturn precedent. Identify the legal principle that the justices should adhere to precedent.

    The legal principle that justices should adhere to precedent is known as "stare decisis." It promotes legal stability and predictability. However, the Court can and does overturn precedent when it believes that an earlier decision was wrong and that societal changes or legal reasoning necessitate a different interpretation of the law.
