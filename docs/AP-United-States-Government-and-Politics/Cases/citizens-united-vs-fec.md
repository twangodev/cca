# Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission

## Questions

- Why were there restrictions on independent expenditures held in previous districts?

    Restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations and unions were primarily imposed to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption in political systems. These restrictions were meant to limit the influence that wealthy and powerful entities could exert on elections and governmental decisions, thereby protecting the integrity of the electoral process and ensuring that political outcomes were determined by voters rather than money.

- How many corporations fund electronic engineering communications?  Note: The use of the term political action committee.

    This question is quite specific, and the number of corporations funding electronic engineering communications through PACs could vary significantly. Generally, corporations in the technology and electronics sectors might use PACs to support candidates or legislation that favor their business interests, but specific numbers would require access to detailed campaign finance reports.

- What does the First Amendment protect?

    The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects several basic freedoms in the United States including freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Regarding speech, it includes the right to express ideas and information without government interference or regulation.

- How could Citizens United have broadcast  Hillary the Movie without violating the law?

    Citizens United could have broadcast "Hillary: The Movie" without violating federal campaign finance laws by framing it as a form of legitimate political speech protected under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruled that the government cannot limit independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, including nonprofit corporations, effectively allowing them to spend on political broadcasts like "Hillary: The Movie."

- How does Justice Stevens define corruption?

    Justice John Paul Stevens, in his dissent in Citizens United v. FEC, defined corruption broadly to include not only outright bribery but also practices that lead to undue influence on elected officials. This broader definition includes the concept of "ingratiation and access" which are seen as subtler forms of corruption that may not be as blatant as quid pro quo arrangements but still pose a threat to democratic integrity and public trust.

- How does the dissent distinguish between corporations and people? What is the result of allowing corporations to run political ads until election day?

    The dissent in Citizens United argued that corporations, unlike individuals, are artificial entities created by the laws of states primarily to make profits. As such, they have different rights and limitations compared to natural persons. Allowing corporations to run political ads up until election day, the dissent argued, could lead to an overwhelming influence of corporate interests over the political landscape, overshadowing the voices of actual voters and potentially leading to policy outcomes that favor corporate interests over public welfare.

- Why does the dissent believe that the majority decisions endangers democratic values?

    The dissent believes that the majority decision in Citizens United endangers democratic values by effectively increasing the power of a wealthy few (i.e., corporate entities and other affluent groups) at the expense of the general electorate. This perceived shift in power dynamics is feared to lead to a form of governance more responsive to the needs and wants of powerful economic entities than to the electorate at large, undermining the fundamental democratic principle of government by the people.
