# Destiny Short Story Analysis

## Prompt

1. What does each story say about sacrifice? What does each story say about the possibility of redemption? Explain.
2. How much does genre, format (shot/long, hearing/seeing/reading), and context influence the way that we think about the expression of these themes in these stories?
3. What connections can you make from these stories to Tale of Two Cities or the Tedx video with Father Gregory Boyle?
## Response

1. In the story, we can see that the protagonist is on the verge of committing suicide and ending her life. In a way she is “sacrificing” herself to the light. The man in the story represents her redemption, as he in a way makes her realize that there is something to live for.
2. She mentions that the protagonist is in the setting of a train station as they mention a train coming in. In addition, it is known that many people commit suicide at train stations. I’ve seen it at least 3 times now smh my head. The author giving words such as “surrender” and “this is it” implies that she is going to end her life. The format of individual lines instead of paragraphs shows that instead of it being a story, it is a sequence of events.
3. This story can be connected to Tale of Two Cities and the Tedx video because all of them have something to do with redeeming people from death. Darnay was redeemed by Carton from his death twice. The brown eyed man stopped the protagonist from committing suicide in the same way how Lucie stopped Carton from achololism and depression. Gregory Boyle and his organization helped people from stopping their dangerous lifestyles and renewing them into society.
