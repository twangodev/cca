1. Use Visual Information What does the photograph of the Soviet soldier in Berlin reveal
   about the post-war world?

   Soviet military power, their influence, as well as the beginning of the cold war.

2. Analyze Style and Rhetoric What was the main purpose of the Address Before a Joint
   Session of Congress that President Truman delivered on March 12, 1947? How does
   Truman’s word choice help support that purpose? Give specific examples from the address.

   The main purpose of President Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on March 12, 1947, was to announce the Truman Doctrine, a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union's expansionist ambitions. Truman's word choice was intended to create a sense of urgency and rally the American people behind his policy by using strong, decisive language, emotionally charged appeals, and historical analogies.

3. Summarize the Truman Doctrine in a sentence or two.
   The Truman Doctrine was a policy of containment announced by President Truman in 1947, which aimed to stop the spread of communism by providing military and economic assistance to countries threatened by Soviet influence.

## The United States Contains Soviet Expansion

1. Analyze Interactions: Among Events What benefits did the Marshall Plan bring to the
   United States?
   The Marshall Plan brought economic benefits to the United States by creating new markets for American goods and services, while also strengthening American alliances in Europe and solidifying America's position as a global leader and advocate for democracy and free markets.
2. Draw Conclusions: Why did Stalin refuse U.S. aid to the Eastern European countries? What
   message did his refusal send?
   Stalin refused U.S. aid to Eastern European countries to maintain Soviet control and influence in the region, sending a clear message that the Soviet Union was committed to spreading communism and establishing pro-Soviet governments in Eastern Europe, which contributed to the growing tensions of the early years of the Cold War.

## Soviet Aggression Drives the Cold War

1. Cite Evidence: Compare the first few “fronts” of the Cold War. Which action was more
   significant, the Berlin airlift or U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey? Support your answer with
   evidence from the text.
   The text suggests that U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey was more significant in containing Soviet expansion during the early years of the Cold War, as it was a proactive measure to prevent the spread of communism. This is supported by evidence that the aid helped to prevent Soviet influence in the Mediterranean, while the Berlin airlift was a response to a crisis that had already occurred.
2. Identify Cause and Effect: What events led to the formation of NATO and the Warsaw
   Pact? What was the purpose of these groups?
   The formation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact was a response to the post-World War II political and ideological divide between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. NATO was established to prevent Soviet expansion into Western Europe, while the Warsaw Pact was created to counter NATO's influence and support Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe. The purpose of both groups was to provide military and political alliances for mutual defense against potential aggression from the opposing bloc.
