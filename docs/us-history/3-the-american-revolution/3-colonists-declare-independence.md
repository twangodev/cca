# The Colonists Declare Independence

## The First Shots are Fired

Colonists of British America declared independence from Britain, chose a republican model for their new government, and confederated the 13 states of the United States of America.

### Changes in Power

General Thomas Gage (British) is named governor of Massachusetts John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and other leaders then convened a Provincial Congress to govern Massachusetts without Gage and began to stockpile arms and ammunition

### The Battles of Lexington and Concord

Gage provokes the battle by sending troops to arrest Hancock and Adams in Lexington and to size Patriot weapons stocked in Concord

Paul Revere and other Patriots tipped off local Patriots to warn of the approaching British, and to prepare the militia (comprised of farmers and soldiers)

## Colonists Disagree Over British Rule

Most colonists supported Continental Congress and the boycott of British imports, except for the Loyalists (people who preferred British rule)

### Loyalists Fear Disorder

Fear of the British was in the atmosphere, as the British had crushed the powers of France and Spain recently

### Loyalists Disagree with Patriots

About a fifth of the colonists remained loyal, and many wished to be neutral. Loyalists were also stereotyped as wealthy elites

Loyalists disliked the taxes, oaths of allegiance, and drafts that were put in place by the Patriots

Slaves sought freedom by joining the British forces

## The Decision to Declare Independence

*Common Sense*, a book by Thomas Paine, as a powerful book about pro-independence

### The Idea of a New Republic

Paine produced the course of action for colonies: Independence from Britain, republican state governments, and a union of new states

Paine also denounced ideas of kings and aristocrats and wanted the commoners to elect all of their governments. He painted the king as the greatest enemy of American liberty and disliked the rigid class structure of Britain.
