# 5: Probability

Probability describes the chance an event occurs over the long run

$$
P(A)\in[0,1]\\\
P(A\mid B)=P(A)+P(B)\\\
P(!A)=1-P(A)
$$

Law of large numbers: As the number of observations increases, the proportion of the occurrence approaches $P(A)$

## Conditional Probability

### Definitions

#### Or Condition

Probability of A or B occurring

If independent:

$$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)
$$

#### And Condition

Probability of A and B occurring

If independent:

$$
P(A \cap B)=P(A) \times P(B)
$$

#### Given Condition

Probably of A given B has occurred.

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
