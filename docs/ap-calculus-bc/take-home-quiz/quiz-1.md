## Prompt

In the sport of basketball, when a player is "fouled," they have the opportunity to take two "free-throws," where the
player shoots the ball two times and can give his team one point for each basket made

An important statistic in basketball is a player's free-throw success percentage over the basketball season. For
example, if a player has 10 free-throw attempts made 8 baskets, their percentage is 80%.

Interestingly, the percentage is always rounded to the nearest percent (for the ease of the viewing public, which
probably does not know math). For example, if a player has made 7 out of 22 free-throws, then the reported percentage is
32%.

During a game, the announcer says that a player is making 78% of their free throws at the moment that the player is
fouled. The player makes two free-throw attempts and makes the first one but misses the second attempt. After the
statistics are updated, the player is now making 76% of their free-throws.

For this player, what are all possible numbers of free-throws made and attempted so far this season (including the ones
that were just made)? (Hint: There are a finite number of solutions)
