# Analyzing Plot Structure

## Prompt

Choose a story – novel, myth, film, short story, etc. That does not tell its story chronologically and analyze its
plot. (5 elements)

Then write a paragraph (5-7 sentences) where you answer the following questions.

- What effect does this plot choice have on the story as a whole?
- How do these structural choices impact the way we understand the characters and the surrounding setting?

## Response

I’ve chosen Dunkirk, directed by Christopher Nolan, and is known for it’s unique 3 consecutive timelines.

Having three separate timelines allowed for extremely sharp cuts/transitions between the scenes. Sometimes it was rather
jarring, going from a relatively quiet scene to the middle of a dogfight. However, the intent of this style of editing
created a sense of urgency and suspense - you could say that while watching the movie, I was sort of on the edge of my
seat the entire time. You would not necessarily be able “predict” what would be the next scene and this also led to some
confusion for me while watching for the first time. I guess this method of story telling could mimic some of the
emotions felt by the actual soldiers that were in the movie.

This structure of having 3 different timelines sort of lets the audience appreciate the scale of the effort at Dunkirk.
Most of the time, stories will focus on one or a few specific characters (oftentimes the protagonists) throughout the
plot, but by using 3 different timelines, which all are scaled differently, it allows the audience to understand the
teamwork, cooperation, and luck that was on the Allies side. The movie does not also seem to have a specific set of
protagonists either, which allows the audience to be able to make form generalized viewpoints about what went down at
Dunkirk.
