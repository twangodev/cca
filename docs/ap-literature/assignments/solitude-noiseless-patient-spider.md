## Prompt

Read "Solitude" by Lord Byron and answer the following questions.

Read" Noiseless Patient Spider" by Walt Whitman and answer the following questions.

1. Why did Whitman decide to break up the stanza into two stanzas?
2. Look at the lines. What do you notice about their form?

## Response

### Solitude

1. The dominant ideas of stanzas #1 seem to be contradicting the definition of solitude. Specifically, the author argues
   how being in nature isn't necessarily true solitude - the author in a sense is able to interact and converse with
   nature, which is shown with his emphasis on the descriptions of nature.

   The following stanza seems to continue the idea of solitude. It's more or less defined as being a loner, even when in
   the presence of others - "the crowd, the hurry, the shock of men."

2. That being physically alone in nature is not true solitude. The speaker argues that when one is alone in nature, one
   is still engaged in a form of dialogue or "converse" with Nature's beauty and wonders. Therefore, this does not
   qualify as solitude in the speaker's eyes.
3. The break didn't necessarily cause me to hesitate or accelerate. I think the break in a sense left a physical and
   literary contrast between the two stanzas, which in a sense emphasizes the speaker's argument on the perceived
   definition of solitude.

### Noiseless Patient Spider

1. I think Whitman decided to break the stanza into two stanzas to emphasize the contrast between the two ideas. The
   first stanza is primarily focused on the spider which talks about building the web, etc., while the second stanza is
   focused on the speaker's soul, which is rather isolated and needs the "connections". This contrast creates a sort of
   parallel, where the spider is building its web, and the speaker is building his soul.
2. There are both five lines within each stanza - which further adds to the parallel. Same "overall structure", yet
   different content, while having the same over arching meaning. There also is a bit of repetition/parallelism, with
   the words "filament, filament, filament" in the first stanza and "till the..." in the second stanza.
