## Response

## I Tasted a Liquor Never Brewed
I don't think there's as much of a comparison to alcoholic intoxication. Instead, I think the author somewhat uses
alcoholic intoxication as a way to describe the beauty of nature, which can come from the intoxication of alcohol. This 
is supported by the author's use of "inebriate of air" and "debauchee of dew", all phrases that can be used to show
the beauty of nature.

#### "Tankards scooped in Pearl"
The tankards which are described sound very luxurious, which could show that drinking alcohol is a luxury. Or, alcohol is something which is treasured.
#### "inns of the Molten Blue"
This may be referencing the sky. The word "molten" could be used to describe the sky, as it is a liquid, constantly changing (perhaps like the taste of alcohol).
#### "snowy Hats"
The snow that collects on hats could signify the coldness of alcohol, or just the total amount of alcohol that is consumed.

## Divorce
Cutlery could be appropriate here because it is something that is commonly used, it's something a part of everyday life,
something we get used to. The use of cutlery can help build that emotions of communal life and intimacy.

The double meaning of "spoons" could be that they are literally everyday spoons, but also the action of spooning, in which two people are close together.

The granite table could be a metaphor for the hardness of the situation they are facing. Granite is known to be a very hard, durable material, and divorce often involves hearts which are very hard and unwilling to change/conform.

The knives that they have hired could refer to divorce attorneys, who often have a reputation for being "cutthroat" and ruthless. They are hired to cut the marriage apart, and by doing so they are legally cutting the hearts of the two people involved.
