## Response

1. Why did this event leave such a profound impact on Frankenstein's life? How does it influence his work or foreshadow the power of his creation?

    The demise of the tree in "Frankenstein" profoundly impacts Victor because it demonstrates the immense power of natural forces, sparking his desire to harness this power himself. This event foreshadows the destructive potential of his scientific endeavors, mirroring the way the tree was obliterated by the lightning strike. It signifies the moment when Victor's fascination with life and death begins, setting him on the path to creating his monster. The tree's destruction is symbolic of the chaos and ruin that Victor's own creation will bring into the world, showcasing the novel's theme of the dangers of usurping nature's role. Furthermore, it symbolically represents the Enlightenment's promise and peril—the pursuit of knowledge can lead to progress but also to unforeseen consequences. This pivotal moment thus encapsulates the dual nature of scientific discovery that is central to the novel's narrative.

2. How is Shelly's description of the novel different from how we see Frankenstein's monster depicted in film, tv, etc.?

    Shelley's allusions in "Frankenstein" paint the monster as a complex, almost poetic figure, carrying a divine yet destructive aura and a haunting, persistent presence. This literary portrayal imbues the creature with a tragic grandeur and a philosophical depth. In stark contrast, the creature’s depiction in many films and TV adaptations is often simplified to a monstrous brute or a pitiable outcast. These portrayals tend to emphasize the visual horror and the physicality of the monster rather than his intellectual and emotional struggles. The nuanced themes of creator’s guilt, existential loneliness, and the desperate search for identity and companionship are frequently overshadowed by the demands of visual storytelling, which tends to favor clear-cut villains and sensationalism over the subtleties found in Shelley’s text.
