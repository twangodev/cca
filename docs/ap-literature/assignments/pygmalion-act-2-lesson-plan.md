## Prompt

Suppose you're cleaning out Higgins's desk and you come upon his lesson plan for Eliza. Write what you think Higgins's lesson plan would say.

Essential Question – what question is the unit/transformation trying to answer?
How does social class influence how we think/talk about growth or change in a person?

Objectives – write two objectives for the individual lesson. What are you trying to achieve? How will you know if you achieve it?
Identify how setting is used to show contrast between characters.
Interpret structural choices in longer fiction and how they contribute to the text's overall meaning.

Instructional Model – How will you teach/model the information you are communicating to Eliza?

Guided Practice – How will you walk through examples with her? What examples will you complete together?

Individual Practice - What will Eliza need to complete outside the "classroom"?

Mirror both Tone & Language choices of Higgins in your Lesson Plan.

Be sure to identify and label each section. You can do them in bullet points, but again make sure you are using the language and tone of Higgins and are directly engaging with Eliza.
