## Response

### Stanza Summaries:
1. The speaker and her heart are weary of life and sit beside a headstone, wishing it bore their names.
2. They feel exhausted because they invested deeply in books and people but were left disappointed and unfulfilled.
3. They feel useless and irrelevant, as if the world is indifferent to them.
4. The speaker reminisces about a happier past with a lover named Ralph, contrasting it with her current emotional exhaustion.
5. She laments the loss of love and the warmth it provided, leaving her and her heart cold and alone.
6. They are so tired that even the temptations of power, pleasure, or simple joys like a child's smile or the sky don't interest them anymore.
7. Despite their weariness and feelings of being used, they do not complain and accept their situation, feeling they have fared as well as they could have expected.

### Speaker's Situation and Analysis:
The speaker is in a state of emotional and spiritual exhaustion, possibly at a graveyard contemplating life's challenges and disappointments. She is tired of failed expectations, broken friendships, and lost love. Her repeated reference to "my heart and I" gives the impression that she's dissociating her emotional self from her physical being. It's as though she's acknowledging that both her intellectual and emotional selves are equally exhausted and disenfranchised by their experiences.

### Tone and Mood:
The tone is one of melancholy and resignation, suggesting a deep emotional fatigue. The mood is somber, fitting the grave setting and the internal despair she's feeling. This reflects her perspective that despite giving her all to life—to relationships, to work, to love—she and her heart find themselves drained and unreciprocated, with little left to give or receive.
