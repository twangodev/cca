# Digging

## Prompt
What is happening in the poem?

How does Haney use visuals to invoke an emotional response in the reader?

Read again. What other story is being communicated here?

## Response
The narrator's father is digging through potato beds. The narrator is watching him and describing the scene.
There are 3 generations (son, father, grandfather) - but they may be "digging" for different reasons

Haney utilizes visuals to communicate the hard work of our ancestors. Since everyone's viewpoint on their ancestors
is unique, by sharing his account, he is able to invoke an emotional response in the reader - as we'll most likely relate 
to him with our thoughts of our ancestor.

The narrator is digging through his memories of his father and grandfather. Though it's physically different, figuratively
the intent is the same - he is also digging.
