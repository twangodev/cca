## Characters in Longer Works of Fiction

- Characters are either dynamic or static
- Character growth and character change does not equal the same thing
- Character development is often enriched by a character's inconsistent behavior

## Stock and Foils

### Stock Characters
Move the plot forwrad or illuminate major character's motivations and development

### Foil
Contrasting character who shines a spotlight ont he protagonist through contrasting traits

!!! example
    Mercutio is the foil to Romeo regarding love.

    Harry Potter is the foil to Draco Malfoy 

## Analyzing Dialogue
Conversation between two or more characters - essential way to reveal character

Three elements to identify when reading dialogue:
- The content of what is being said
- They way it is being said, including the language and the state directions for delivering the line
- The reaction and response from other characters

### Soliloquy and Monologues
A character, alone on state, reveals their thoughts or emotions, as if the character is thinking out loud

## Long Fiction and Drama

### Setting

#### Physical Set and Props
!!! question
    What do set pieces reveal about character, plot, etc.? Can they foreshadow later events?

#### Historical Context
A time and place that has its own political, economic, or social norms and upheavals. Will go unmentioned most times because author assumes reader has general knowledge of event

#### Social and Cultural Contexts
Manners, mores, customs, rituals, and codes of conduct. Science Fiction often creates its own

!!! question
    How do the social and cultural contexts of the text reveal important information about the setting of the work?


### Plot and Structure
Longer works of fiction leave more room for more than one major conflict - many of them continue to develop and eventually intersect

!!! question
    What conflicts do we have already through the two acts (of Pygmalion)? What other conflicts do we see on the peripheral?
