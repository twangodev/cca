## Analyzing Dialogue
Conversation between two or more characters - essential way to reveal character

Three elements to identify when reading dialogue:
- The content of what is being said
- They way it is being said, including the language and the state directions for delivering the line
- The reaction and response from other characters

### Soliloquy and Monologues
A character, alone on state, reveals their thoughts or emotions, as if the character is thinking out loud
