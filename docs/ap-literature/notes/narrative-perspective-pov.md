# Narrative Perspective & Point of View
All focus on who tells the story, how they tell it, and how they and we, as readers, understand their roles in the narrative

## Point of View
The position from which a narrator relates the events of a narrative

### First Person
Uses first-person pronouns such as I and we. See the story through the lens of one character. Usually the main character, though it could be a minor one too.

### Second Person
Puts the reader directly into the story; rarely used, could be viewed as gimmicky because it  makes the reading too literal. However, it can create intimacy

### Third Person
Tells the story with third-person pronouns - he, she, and it. Views all events from a distance.

#### Limited
Views all events from one person's perspective; good insight into how that character views the world

#### Omniscient
Views and knows events from perspectives of multiple characters.

#### Objective
Most neutral and impartial. Does not follow a single character or enter one's perspective. Don't know what characters are thinking or feeling.
