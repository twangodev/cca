# Character and Plot 

## Commercial vs. Literary Fiction

Commercial fiction is solely used to entertain or make money

Literary Fiction has artistic intentions looking to yield and entertain but also understanding - broaden, deepen, and sharpen the reader’s awareness of life

## Characters

Protagonist, Antagonist

### Revealing Characters
Physical, emotional psychological, dialogue, behavior will all contribute to how a character is portrayed

#### Direct Characterization
When a narrator explicitly describes the background, motivation, temperament

#### Indirect Characterization 
Author requires the audience to infer what a character is like through what the character says, thinks, or others say

## Narrative Structure

Coming of age story (bildungsroman) - shows how the young character grows from innocence to experience

### Epiphany
A pivotal realization about life

## Commercial Fiction Characters

### Main Character 

- Less easily labeled and pigeonholed
- Could be wholly unsympathetic or even despicable
- Deals with characters who have both “good” and “evil” impulses; three -dimensional
- Allow the reader to observe human nature in complexity & multiplicity
- Good writers “show, not tell,” which allow the characters to be dramatized

#### Consistent with Behavior
- Attractive and sympathetic
- Not perfect, but fundamentally decent, honest good-hearted, and preferable good-looking
- May have larger-than-life qualities or defy laws of “ordinary “ people
- Vices must be willing to be accepted by the reader (e.g. James Bond)

## Character Categories

### Flat Characters
Only have one or two predominant traits; summed up in a sentence or two

!!! tip
    Most short stories will only have one or two round characters; minor characters must primarily remain flat

### Stock Characters

- Stereotyped figures that appear in fiction, so we recognize them immediately
- The strong, silent sheriff, glamorous international spy, the cruel stepmother, mad scientist, brilliant, eccentric detective

### Static Character
Remains the same person from beginning to end
