# Character and Plot

## Commercial vs. Literary Fiction

Commercial fiction is solely used to entertain or make money

Literary Fiction has artistic intentions looking to yield and entertain but also understanding - broaden, deepen, and
sharpen the reader’s awareness of life

## Characters

Protagonist, Antagonist

### Revealing Characters

Physical, emotional psychological, dialogue, behavior will all contribute to how a character is portrayed

#### Direct Characterization

When a narrator explicitly describes the background, motivation, temperament

#### Indirect Characterization

Author requires the audience to infer what a character is like through what the character says, thinks, or others say

## Narrative Structure

Coming of age story (bildungsroman) - shows how the young character grows from innocence to experience

### Epiphany

A pivotal realization about life

## Commercial Fiction Characters

### Main Character

- Less easily labeled and pigeonholed
- Could be wholly unsympathetic or even despicable
- Deals with characters who have both “good” and “evil” impulses; three -dimensional
- Allow the reader to observe human nature in complexity & multiplicity
- Good writers “show, not tell,” which allow the characters to be dramatized

#### Consistent with Behavior

- Attractive and sympathetic
- Not perfect, but fundamentally decent, honest good-hearted, and preferable good-looking
- May have larger-than-life qualities or defy laws of “ordinary “ people
- Vices must be willing to be accepted by the reader (e.g. James Bond)

## Character Categories

### Flat Characters

Only have one or two predominant traits; summed up in a sentence or two

### Round Characters

Complex & many-sided

!!! tip
Most short stories will only have one or two round characters; minor characters must primarily remain flat

### Stock Characters

- Stereotyped figures that appear in fiction, so we recognize them immediately
- The strong, silent sheriff, glamorous international spy, the cruel stepmother, mad scientist, brilliant, eccentric
  detective

### Static Character

Remains the same person from beginning to end

### Developing & Dynamic Character

Undergoes some distinct change of character, personality, or outlook

## Plot and Structure

Authors arrange conflicts and resolutions to create logical patterns of cause-and-effect and to develop characters’
relationships with each other. Conflicts are then born from these relationships

### Basic Narrative Structure

#### Exposition

Opening section that provide background information about characters, setting and basic situation

#### Rising Action

After an inciting incident or even, the conflict and complications the main character experiences begin to build

#### Climax

The emotional tension or suspense of the plot reaches its peak

#### Falling Action

Details the result (or fallout) of the climax or turning point

#### Denouement (Resolution)

“Untying the not” balance is restored to the world after conflict has been resolved - many authors leave this
“unfinished” so readers can construct their own meaning at the end of the story

### Strategies of Structure

#### Immediate Introduction

Conflict is introduced immediately, from the start

#### Flashbacks

Describe events that have already taken place

#### Foreshadowing

Hinting at events that will happen later in the story
