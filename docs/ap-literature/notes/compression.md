# Compression

!!! question "Why is compression important in literature?"
    - Saying as much as possible as briefly as possible; Nothing is wasted; each word ad detail are carefully chosen by the author
    - Requires exercising a careful selectivity - details and incidents those that do not contribute a unified effect of the story
    - Some details serve multiple purposes at the same time - symbol, allegory, and fantasy

## Symbol
Literary symbol - something that means *more* than what it suggests on the surface

- Object, person, situation, action or other element that has a literal meaning in the story but suggests or represents other meanings as well
- Name symbolism - Authors may choose names (not as labels - nationality, gender, etc.) but suggest something about them
