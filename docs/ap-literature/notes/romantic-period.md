# Romantic Period

Inspired by the French Revolution (redefining of political power) and the Industrial Revolution changed everything)

## 6 Key Ideas

### Folklore
Natural, Accessible, and comprised of simpler/more ordinary language (against the snobbish prose & art)

- Saw Shakespeare as a rebellious figure - an icon, example
- Comedy & Tragedy didn't belong mixed - one or the other
- Champion the individual

### Shakespeare
### Gothic & Medieval (not modern)
Dripping with blood, horror, emphasis on fear, supernatural inquiries

- Violence as a plot device

### Romantic Love (not just marriage contracts)
Love was the driving force for everything (marriage was not about wealth or security)

- Passionate, explicit, erotic
- Love can be between anyone and should be openly explored
- Develop the idea of individuals (exploring identity)
- Lived recklessly, died young

### Individualism (not fixed roles)
### Nature & Countryside (not industrialization)
Celebrated awe & wonder of the natural world

- Used poetry to demonstrate the horrific conditions of the poor/city folk
