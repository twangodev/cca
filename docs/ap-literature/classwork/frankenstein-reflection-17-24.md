# Frankenstein Chapters 17-24

## Prompt

1. Frankenstein has many opportunities to tell people of his "mistake" and warn those whom he loves, yet he chooses not to. Why do you think he doesn't warn any of them?
2. What does Frankenstein make Walton promise him before he dies? Do you think this was his intention the whole time? Why or why not? Why doesn't Walton fulfill this request?

## Response

1. Frankenstein feels deep shame and guilt for having created the creature. This emotional burden likely prevents him from sharing his secret, as doing so would mean confronting his own failures and the horror of what he has done. Additionally, Frankenstein might fear that others would not believe his story or, worse, think him mad. He may also feel that it is his sole responsibility to deal with the creature or that involving others would unnecessarily endanger them or that it is his duty alone to rectify his mistake.
2. Though Frankenstein makes Walton promise him to destroy the creature, I don't think this could have been his intention the whole time. I think that as he is telling the story, he probably realizes he's able to use Walton to fulfill his goal, but he probably didn't have this in mind to begin with. Walton doesn't furfill the request as he might be scared himself after hearing the story from Frankenstein, given the fact that everyone who has been on the wrong side of the monster has died.
