# Creature Tale Reflection Questions

## Prompt

1. Describe the education of the creation to life and its surroundings, as well as to human life through his observation of his neighbors and the village

    Think of specific examples, both in acclimation to existence (outside a laboratory) and to interaction with others

    How does the creation's absorption of knowledge backfire on him? How does it do the same for Frankenstein?

2. How does the Creation's recounting of the events with the DeLacy's with the young girl at the creek (and subsequent man), William & Justine influence how we understand and empathize with it? Do these experiences justify his actions (William & Justine) or what he desires from Frankenstein? Explain in thorough detail

## Response

The Creature's education and acclimation to existence underscore the novel's exploration of knowledge, isolation, and the repercussions of unbridled scientific pursuit. The creature learns about the world through his observations of the De Lacey family, absorbing complex human emotions and social dynamics. His self-taught literacy, fostered by books like "Paradise Lost," ironically deepens his sense of alienation, as he becomes increasingly aware of his solitary existence and monstrous nature. These revelations, instead of enlightening, breed a profound resentment towards his creator, Victor Frankenstein. On the other hand, Frankenstein's own pursuit of knowledge, although initially noble in intention, fails as he's essentially consumed by his own pride. His creation of the Creature ultimately results in personal ruin and the loss of his loved ones, illustrating the perilous consequences of scientific endeavor detached from ethical responsibility and foresight.
