# The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>

Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>

And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.<br>

## Application to Economics
The road not taken can be interpreted as making two choices. One choice is described as a very well maintained and often traveled-upon road. The other choice describes a road which hasn’t really been used. In this specific scenario, Frost takes the road which wasn’t often taken - which is a sacrifice he makes, and in turn he believes he has gotten a better reward. I guess you can sum it up as risk and reward, which is something that can be applied to economics.
