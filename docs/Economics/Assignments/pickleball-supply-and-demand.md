# Pickleball Supply and Demand

The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increased demand for outdoor, socially-distanced activities like pickleball. This surge in interest resulted in higher sales of equipment and potential shortages of pickleball courts. Additionally, more people sought coaching, potentially raising prices for lessons. Manufacturers and communities might have innovated in response to these demands, creating alternative playing spaces or solutions. Post-pandemic, the heightened interest in pickleball could lead to a sustained demand for related products and services.
