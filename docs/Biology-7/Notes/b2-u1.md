# Book 2 Unit 1

## Living Characteristics
- Cells: A membrane-covered structure that contains all the materials necessary for life
- Stimulus: A change that affects the activity if an organism is called a stimulus
- Homeostasis: The maintenance of a stable internal environment
## Reproduction
- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
- RNA: Ribonucleic Acid
- Sexual Reproduction: Two parents produce offspring that share the characteristics of both parents
- Asexual Reproduction: Each offspring receives an exact copy of the parents DNA
## Energy use of Living Things
- Plants convert energy from the sun into food
- Other organisms get energy from plants
## Growth and Maturing of Living Things
- Unicellular organisms grows, becomes larger, then divides, forming two cells
- Multicellular organism grows, number of cells in body increases, organism becomes bigger
- Develops and changes form and size
## What living things need to survive
- Water
- Air
- Food
- Shelter
## How Living Things Get Food
- Producers produce their own nutrients
- Some examples of producers are plants and algae
- Consumers consume other organisms for nutrients
- Some examples of consumers are Animals such as turtles and lions
- There are three types of consumers herbivore, Omnivore and Carnivore
- Decomposers decompose other organisms for nutrients
- Some examples of decomposers are fungi and bacteria
## Darwinâ€™s Voyage
- Evolution: The process by which population change over time
- Differences Among Species
    - Darwin observed finches beaks were bigger
- Artificial Selection: The practice by which humans select plants or animals for breeding based on desired traits
## Four Parts of Natural Selection
- Overproduction
    - When a plant or animal reproduces, it usually makes more offspring than the environment can support
- Genetic Variation
    - Within a population there are natural differences *(aka variations)*
- Selection
    - Adaptation
- Natural Selection
    - The process by which organisms that inherit advantageous traits tend to reproduce more successfully than other organisms do
    - Variations: When in a population there are differences in traits
    - Mutation: When over time a individual or populations traits change over generations
    - Adaptation: An inherited trait helps an organism survive and reproduce in an environment
## Species Changing over time
- Adaptations: Inherited traits that help organisms survive and reproduce
- Genetic Difference Add Up
    - Parents and offspring have small genetic differences between them
## Environment Change
- Adaptations can allow a species to survive
- Some Species May Become
- Extinct

## How do fossils form
- Organisms changed over time
- Most fossils form in sedimentary rock
- Fossil Record
    - All fossils discovered make up a fossil record
- Fossil: The remains or imprints of once living
- Similar DNA
    - Cytochrome C Differences Table

    | Lamprey       | 20                                                       |

## Fossil
A trace or imprint of a living thing that is preserved by geological processes
- Fossil Record: All of the fossils that have been discovered worldwide

## Classifying Living Things
- Physical Characteristics
    - Scientists look at skeletal structure
    - Scientists study how organisms develop from egg to adult
- Chemical Characteristics
    - Scientists can study genetic material such as DNA and RNA
    - Organisms that have similar gene sequences
    - Proteins and hormones can also characterize organisms
- Naming living things
    - Species: A group of organisms that are very closely related
    - Genus: Includes similar species
    - Levels of classification
        - DKPCOFGS
            - Do - Domain
            - Koalas - Kingdom
            - Poop - Phylum
            - Cows - Class
            - Or - Order
            - Fantastic - Family
            - Great - Genus
            - Snakes - Species
    - Prokaryotes: Single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus in their cells
    - Eukaryotes: Made up of cells that have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles
        - More complex than prokaryotes
    - Three Domains
        - Bacteria: Made up of prokaryotes that usually have a cell wall and reproduce by cell division
        - Archaea: Made up of prokaryotes, have different makeup of cell walls and genetics.
        - Eukarya: Made up of all Eukaryotes
            - Protista
                - Single-celled or multicellular organisms such as algae and slime molds
                - "Junk Drawer" Kingdom
            - Plantae
                - Multicellular organisms that have cell walls, mostly made out of cellulose.
                - Make food through process known as photosynthesis
            - Fungi
                - Gets energy by absorbing materials
                - Can reproduce sexually or asexually
            - Animalia
                - Multicellular organisms that lack cell walls
                - Must get nutrients by consuming other organisms
