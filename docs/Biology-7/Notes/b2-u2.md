## Prokaryotes
- Characteristics
    - Doesn't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles
    - Almost always single-celled
- Bacteria: A domain of prokaryotes that usually have a cell and usually reproduce by cell division
    - Characteristics
        - Single-celled
            - Can stick together the for strands of films
        - Round, spiral, or rod-shaped
        - They live everywhere
    - Reproduction
        - Binary Fission: Reproduction in which one single-celled organism splits into two single-celled organisms
        - Steps
            - Copying the chromosomes
            - Chromosomes separate
            - One on each side of the cell
            - Cells membrane grows inward, separating the two halves
            - New cell walls form and separate the two new cells
- Archaea: A domain of prokaryotes that are genetically very different from bacteria and that have unique chemicals in their cell walls
    - Cell walls are chemically different
    - Molecules are unique
    - Can survive in extreme conditions
- Bacteria
    - Characteristics
        - Most amount of individuals
        - Single-celled
        - Round, Spiral, or Rod shaped
        - Lives Everywhere
    - Reproduction
        - Binary Fission: Reproduction when a single-celled organism splits into two single-celled organisms
- Viruses
    - A virus is a microscopic particle that cannot replicate on its own.
    - Characteristics
        - Gets inside cell to inject in DNA  (destroys cell)
        - People, plants, animals, and prokaryotes can be infected
        - Protein coat give virus the shape
        - Not living
            - Contains genetic material but can’t perform living functions
                - Do not use energy from nutrients
                - Can’t remain homeostasis
                - Can’t grow
                - Do not respond to stimuli
                - Can’t function on its own
                - Can replicate only in a cell
    - Reproduction
        - Enters host cell
            - A host is a living thing that a virus or parasite uses for resources or shelter.
            - Proteins on virus matches proteins on host
                - Virus can now invade host
        - Multiplying DNA
            - Virus enters cell or when virus’s genetic material is in cell
                - Takes over cell
                - Host makes new protein for virus
                - New parts assemble in host
                    - Creates new virus
                    - Bursts host
                    - Can stay inactive in cell

## Protists
A group of eukaryotic organisms that cannot be classified as fungi, plants, or animals

- Characteristics
    - Single-celled or multi-celled
    - Membrane-bound organelles
    - Complex Structures for movement
- Reproduction
    - Asexual Reproduction
        - Binary Fission
        - Fragmentation
    - Sexual Reproduction
        - Gametes join together
        - Spores
- Types of protists
    - Animal-like Protists
    - Fungus-like Protists
    - Plant-like protists
  
## Fungi
Spore-producing organisms that absorb nutrients from the environment

- Reproduction
    - Asexual Reproduction
    - Fragmentation
    - Spores
    - Pudding
- Sexual Reproduction
    - Two individuals join toge

## Plants
- Characteristics
    - Multicellular Eukaryotes
        - Membrane bound organelles with nucleus
    - Two staged life cycle
        - Sporophyte
            - Makes spores
            - Often identical to parent
        - Gametophyte
            - Gametes
                - Female= eggs
                - Male= sperms
                    - Produces eggs
    - Walls and vacuoles
    - Make their own food
        - Photosynthesis
        - Chlorophyll
            - Green pigment captures energy from sun
- Nonvascular and vascular plants
    - Vascular system: tube like tissues that transport water, nutrients to different parts of the organism
    - Nonvascular
        - Diffusion
            - Water must move from environment to plant
        - Seedless nonvascular
            - All nonvascular plants are seedless
                - Produce by spreading spores
    - Vascular
        - Separated into 2 systems
            - Root system
                - Supply plants with water, minerals
                - Anchors plant
        - Shoot system
            - Stems
                - Provide support
                - Transporting water, minerals and sugar
            - Leaves
                - Where food is made
                - Help prevent water loss
                    - Curved inward leaves
        - Seedless vascular
            - Most vascular plants reproduce by spores
- Seed plants
    - Vocab
        - Seed
            - Plant embryo enclosed in a protective coating
        - Pollen
            - A tiny structure in which sperm forms
    - Classifications
        - Gymnosperm
            - Seeds that are not enclosed in a fruit
                - Cones etc…
        - Angiosperms
            - Vascular plants that produce flowers and fruits surrounding the seed
                - Reproductive system
