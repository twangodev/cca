## Cells
The smallest functional and structural unit of all living organisms

- Cell Theory: Lists three basic characteristics of all cells and organisms
    - All Organisms are made up of one or more cells
        - Unicellular Organisms: Made up of one cell
        - Multicellular Organisms: Made up of many cells
            - Cells often have specialized functions
    - The cell is the basic unit of all organisms
    - All cells come from existing cells
    - Creators of the Cell Theory
        - Matthias Schleiden - Theory 1
        - Theodor Schwann - Theory 1, Theory 2
        - Rudolf Virchow - Theory 3
        - Anton van Leeuwenhoek - Theory 1
- What cells have in common
    - Cell Membrane: A protective layer that covers a cell's surface
    - Cytoplasm: The region enclosed by the cell membrane that includes fluid and other organelles
    - Organelles: A small body in a cell's cytoplasm that is specialized to perform a specific function
    - DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
        - In some cells, DNA is contained in the nucleus
- Two Types of Cells
    - Prokaryote: A single-celled organism that doesn't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles
        - DNA is located in the cytoplasm
    - Eukaryotic: An organism made up of cells that contain their DNA in a nucleus
        - Most are multi-cellular
## Atoms
Basic particles
## Molecule
A group of atoms that are held together by a chemical bond

- Import Molecules in cells
    - Lipid: A fat molecule
    - Proteins: A molecule made of smaller molecules known as amino acids
    - Carbohydrates: Sugars, starches, and fiber
    - Nucleic Acids: A molecule that carries information in cells
- Phospholipid: A lipid that contains phosphorous
- Form the cell membrane and allow water to pass through
- Osmosis: The process in which water moves through the cell membrane

## Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells
- Parts that protect & support the cell
- Genetic Material in the nucleus

## Organelles found in plant and animal cells
- Mitochondria: A place where cellular respiration occurs
- Ribosomes: The organelle that makes proteins by putting together chains of amino acids using instructions coded in the cell's DNA
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: A system of membranes near the nucleus
    - Assists in production, processing, and transport of proteins
- Golgi Complex: The membrane-bound organelle that packages and distributes materials

## Parts found in plant cells
- Cell wall: A rigid structure that surrounds the cell membrane
- Large Central Vacuole: A fluid-filled vesicle found in cells of most animals, plants, and fungi
- Chloroplasts: Organelles in which photosynthesis occur

## Parts found in animal cells
- Lysosomes: Organelles that contain digestive enzymes, which break down worn-out or damaged organelles, waste material, and foreign invaders

## How living things are organized
- Cells
    - Multicellular
    - Unicellular
- Tissues: A group of similar cells that perform a common function
- Organs: A structure made up of a collection of tissues that carry out a specialized function
- Organ System: A group of organs that work together to perform body functions

## Structure: The arrangement of parts in an organism or an object
- Function: What the structure of a cell, tissue, or an organ determines
    - Structure determines function

## Systems performing to meet the needs of cells
- Unicellular
    - Must perform all functions
        - Get nutrients
        - Exchange gases
        - Removing wastes
- Multicellular
    - Have different cell types to perform functions
    - Delivering Nutrients
        - Break food mechanically and chemically
    - Delivering Oxygen
        - A function of the respiratory system
    - Removing Wastes

## Homeostasis
The maintenance of a constant internal state in a changing environment

- Exchanging Materials
    - Passive Transport
        - Diffusion: The movement of molecules from high concentrations to low levels
        - Osmosis: The diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane
    - Active Transport: The movement of particles against a concentration gradient and requires the cell to use energy
- Endocytosis: The process by which a cell uses energy to surround/enclose a particle in a vesicle to bring the particle into a the cell
- Exocytosis: The process when particles are enclosed in a vesicle and released from a cell

## Functions of Cells
- Cells Need Energy (from food)

## How Plants make food
- Photosynthesis: The process when plants use energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to make sugar
- 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy -> C6H12O6 + 6CO2

## How Cells get Food
- ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate
    - Powers many chemical reactions that enables the cell to survive
- Cellular Respiration: The process of breaking down food to produce ATP
- C6H12O6 + 6CO2 -> 6C2 + 6H2O + Chemical Energy (ATP)
