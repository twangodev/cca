# Rome's Problems

Have you ever wondered why a big empire such as Rome would fall? It was once greatly admired, either for it's army, wealth, or simply the enormous amount of people in the empire. Rome had many problems such as population decline, a weak and betrayful army, and economic trouble.

Rome mainly fell due to its lack of people. Romans weren't very interested in raising children. Instead, they would live and enjoy the luxuries of life. This affected Rome so much that almost half the population had gone down from around in about 300 years. With half the population gone, the Roman legion shrank. Without enough people in the legion, Rome was more vulnerable to barbarians. Population decline had a big role of bringing Rome down.

Without a strong legion, Rome could not defend itself. The government hired german mercenaries who would fight well. These german legionnaires betrayed the empire very often. In the midst of battle, they would switch onto the enemies side. In fact, most of the mercenaries were the people who sacked Rome. Rome was extremely weak from the lack of defences.

Economic failure had a major impact on Rome. Rome couldn't get money to pay for roads and other parts of the empire. Rome also suffered from inflation. Rome's coins were partially gold and other metal, which decreased the value of the coin.

All of these led to the fall of Rome. Rome was once a great country, but was crushed by population decline, a weak legion, and economic failure. Will America might fall, it was based off the roman system. One of the things America could spend a little bit more time and effort is on public education. With better education, people can get better jobs and can possibly reduce the risk of economic failure. Hopefully, America will avoid population decline, a weak army, and economic failure.
