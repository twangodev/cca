- They discover a letter written by Dr. Manette when he was imprisoned

## Questions:
1. I think that Monsieur Defarge doesn't really care as much about his feelings towards Darney when compared to Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge goes to great lengths to spill blood, such as knitting their names to analyzing Dr. Manette's handwriting.
2. I think that the narrator is trying to say that Death and the guillotine are extremely popular and common to find, but values such as liberty, equality, fraternity are almost non-existent/rare
3. The fact that Dickens mentions the Vengeance makes everything more frightening. He also uses words with a general negative/frightening connotation, such as extermination, rattle, and destruction.
4. Well if the chemist warns Carton not to mix the two chemicals together, if mixed together it probably would be like a deadly/fatal reaction. I think this would also have something to do with Darney, as he wouldn't just randomly go buy chemicals.
5. It's most likely rigged. The juryman is the Jacques Three, so that immediately should set off red flags. I would also say the president is also somewhat biased, as he doesn't want to hear Dr Manette's perspective on the letter
