## Inverse Variation

### Classifying Equations

- None: \( x \) not applicable
- Direct: \( ax \) (where \( a \) is a constant)
- Inverse: \( \frac{a}{x} \) (where \( x \neq 0 \))

### Classifying Data

- None: \( xy \) and \( \frac{y}{x} \) are not constant
- Direct: \( \frac{y}{x} \) is constant
- Inverse: \( xy \) is constant

## Graphing Rational Functions

### Rational Function Form

A rational function can be expressed as \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \)

#### Simple Rational Function: \( y = \frac{a}{x} \)

1. Has the same asymptotes, domain, and range as \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \)
2. Graphing Translations with \( y = \frac{a}{(x−h)} + k \)

    - **Step 1:** Draw the asymptotes \( x = h \) and \( y = k \)
    - **Step 2:** Plot points to the left and to the right of the vertical asymptote
    - **Step 3:** Draw the two branches of the hyperbola so that they pass through the plotted points and approach the asymptotes

#### Other Rational Functions: \( y = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \)

1. Vertical Asymptote: \( x = -\frac{d}{c} \)
2. Horizontal Asymptote: \( y = \frac{a}{c} \)
3. Convert \( y = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \) to \( y = \frac{a}{(x−h)} + k \) using long division or synthetic division

## Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions

### Rational Expression

A fraction whose numerator and denominator are nonzero polynomials

### Simplified Form

When a rational expression's numerator and denominator have no common factors

### Simplifying Rational Expressions

\( \frac{ac}{bc} = \frac{a}{b} \) when \( ac \) and \( bc \) are not zero.

- **Tip:** Factor the polynomial to find common factors

### Multiplying Rational Expressions

\( \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd} \) (where \( b,d \neq 0 \))

- **Tip:** Factor the polynomials to find common factors to simplify

### Dividing Rational Expressions

\( \frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bc} \) (where \( b,c,d \neq 0 \))

- **Tip:** Factor the polynomials to find common factors to simplify

## Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

### Adding and Subtracting with Like Denominators

- **Addition:** \( \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a+b}{c} \) (where \( c \neq 0 \))
- **Subtraction:** \( \frac{a}{c} - \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a-b}{c} \)

### Adding and Subtracting with Unlike Denominators

- **Addition:** \( \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{cd} \)
- **Subtraction:** \( \frac{a}{c} - \frac{b}{d} = \frac{ad - bc}{cd} \)

## Solving Rational Equations

For the equation \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \), cross multiplication gives us:

$$
ad = bc
$$
