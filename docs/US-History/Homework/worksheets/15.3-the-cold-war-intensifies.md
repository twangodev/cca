# 15.3 The Cold War Intensifies

## The Arms Race Intensifies Tensions

1. Identify Cause and Effect: As you read the texts in this lesson, use the chart below to take notes about the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the first column, note causes, or reasons for the continuing Cold War and arms race. In the second column, note effects, or outcomes of each cause.

    | Cause                                                                   | Effect                                                                             |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | The U.S finds evidence that the Soviet Union has set off an atomic bomb | The U.S. begins to develop and test a hydrogen bomb                                |
    | Soviet Union develops and tests it’s own hydrogen bomb                  | The arms race intensifies, and tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union increase |
2. Explain an Argument: Briefly explain the argument that a program of mutually assured destruction prevents countries from actually using weapons of mass destruction against each other. Do you think this argument is valid? Explain why or why not.

   The argument for mutually assured destruction is that if both countries have enough nuclear weapons to destroy each other, neither country will want to use them because it would result in the destruction of both countries. This argument assumes that both countries have rational leaders who will not act irrationally or impulsively, and that there are effective communication channels between the two countries to avoid misunderstandings. Whether or not this argument is valid is debatable, as it assumes a lot about human behavior and decision-making in high-stakes situations.


## Eisenhower’s Response to Soviet Aggression

1. Compare and Contrast: Truman’s and Eisenhower’s responses to Soviet aggression. How were they similar? How were they different?

   Truman's and Eisenhower's responses to Soviet aggression were similar in that both believed in containing Soviet expansion and in the importance of the NATO alliance. However, Truman pursued a policy of containment through economic aid and military support for countries threatened by communism, while Eisenhower pursued a policy of brinksmanship, threatening massive retaliation against the Soviet Union if it crossed a certain line. Additionally, Eisenhower favored a greater reliance on nuclear weapons than Truman did.

2. Categorize: What were some benefits of Eisenhower’s military policy? What were some drawbacks?
   Benefits of Eisenhower's military policy included a deterrent effect on the Soviet Union, as well as a perception of strength and resolve among U.S. allies. Drawbacks included the risk of nuclear war, the strain on the U.S. economy, and the possibility of provoking the Soviet Union into taking more aggressive actions.

## International Cold War Conflicts

1. Analyze Interactions Among People and Events: How did events during the Cold War shape future developments in the Middle East? Give at least two examples

   Events during the Cold War shaped future developments in the Middle East by creating a power vacuum in certain countries and contributing to the rise of authoritarian regimes. Additionally, Cold War policies and interventions fueled anti-American and anti-Western sentiment in the region. Two examples of events that had significant impacts on the region were the CIA's overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1953 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

2. Draw Conclusions: Did the United States overestimate or underestimate the Soviet Union in the early 1950s? Use evidence from the text throughout this lesson to support your conclusions

   The United States may have overestimated the Soviet Union in the early 1950s, as evidenced by the exaggerated fears of Soviet espionage and infiltration that led to the Red Scare and the McCarthy hearings. Additionally, the U.S. overestimated the Soviet Union's military capabilities, leading to an excessive focus on building up the U.S. military and developing new weapons systems. However, as the Soviet Union demonstrated its capabilities through the development of nuclear weapons and the launching of Sputnik, the U.S. began to take the Soviet Union more seriously as a threat.
