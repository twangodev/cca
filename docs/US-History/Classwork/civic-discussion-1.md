# Civic Discussion #1

## Prompt

Was the British Tax Policy in America justified after the French and Indian War?

## Step 1: Develop Questions and Plan the Investigation

1. What do you think is the main argument on the “yes” side of the question?
   The colonies didn’t pay share in the beginning, as their tax rates were pretty low. Because of this, it was justified to make each British citizen
2. What do you think is the main argument on the “no” side of the question?
   Salutary neglect
3. As a group, come to agreement about the major points on both sides of the question

| Major Points: “Yes” | Major Points: “No” |
| --- | --- |
| British gave land and they would owe them

Taxes for protection

The colonies didn’t pay share in the beginning, as their tax rates were pretty low. Because of this, it was justified to make each British citizen

The author’s perspective is that the British were justified to tax the Americans after the French and Indian War. The author says that the American colonists were both paid more and taxed less than the British. He then provides statistical evidence to prove his point. For example, “By 1714, British citizens in Great Britain were paying on a per capita bases 10 times as much as the average ‘American’ in the 13 colonies” This taxation, along with the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, lead to the American colonists opposition British taxation and control, which eventually lead to the revolution.

The colonies were taxing themselves | Townshend Acts, Stamp Act, Intolerable Acts were unjustifiable

Gipson presents a hypothetical: What if France had won the war? Would the colonists resist a tax Parliament imposed? The author claims that it is not reasonable to believe that there would be no powerful movement in the future, not to mention American independence.

Taxation without representation

Salutary neglect: For the previous 150 years, colonists were able to self-govern. This was called salutary neglect. When Parliament wanted greater control over the colonies, they resisted because they were used to salutary neglect. Parliament re-established its sovereignty using force. |

## Step 2: Apply Disciplinary Concepts and Tools

### Source A

Title: Living Heritage

Author: UK Parliament

#### Summary

No. Even though British needed to pay off their debts, the taxes were unfair and unjustifiable.. Example of these were the Townshend Acts, the Stamp Act, and the Intolerable Acts

### Source B

Title: Parliamentary taxation of colonies international trade and the American Revolution.

Author: N/A

#### Summary

The Author is leaned more towards the colonists side. He doesn't seem to support the taxation because he talks more about how the colonists reaction where to the intolerable acts and the injustice of the British imposing the taxes. The author's perspective was that the colonists were not entirely wrong for their actions but he doesn't put a lot of his opinions in the article. He states the reasons for the British tax policy and how the Colonists found it unfair and against their rights. He mentions most of the problems on both sides enough that it would be considered neutral but I would say he was in favor of the colonists who found the tax policies as an injustice.

### Source C

Title: The American Revolution as an Aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1745-1764

Author: Lawrence Henry Gipson

#### Summary

The author’s perspective is that the British Tax Policy was unjustified after the French and Indian War. Gipson presents a hypothetical: What if France had won the war? Would the colonists resist a tax Parliament imposed? The author claims that it is not reasonable to believe that there would be no powerful movement in the future, not to mention American independence. The colonists would have done the very same thing - because it was unjustified in their eyes. Gipson concludes the article by saying that “Attempts on part of the Crown and Parliament to restore by statute the old balance led directly to the American constitutional crisis”

### Source D

Title: The American Revolution

Author: Joseph C. Morton

#### Summary

The author really talks about both sides of the spectrum. He talks about the taxes the British gave, and how the colonists were almost always against it. They didn’t think they should be taxed from somewhere that they were not represented properly. But then the author changes it and talks about the other side, how there were the people that tried to justify the taxes and try to keep peace from Britain and the colonists.

### Source E

Title: Was the American Revolution Inevitable?

Author: Francis D Cogliano

#### Summary

No. For the previous 150 years, colonists were able to self-govern. This was called salutary neglect. When Parliament wanted greater control over the colonies, they resisted because they were used to salutary neglect. Parliament re-established its sovereignty using force.

### Source F

Title: Tea, Taxes, and the Revolution

Author: Grover G. Norquist

#### Summary

The author’s perspective is that the British were justified to tax the Americans after the French and Indian War. The author says that the American colonists were both paid more and taxed less than the British. He then provides statistical evidence to prove his point. For example, “By 1714, British citizens in Great Britain were paying on a per capita bases 10 times as much as the average ‘American’ in the 13 colonies” This taxation, along with the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, lead to the American colonists opposition British taxation and control, which eventually lead to the revolution.

### Source G

Title: The American Revolution Reconsidered

Author: Eric Robson

#### Summary

The author believes that the taxes were justified. The author talks about how the colonists were already taxing themselves, so it would be a little bit contradicting. The author implies that its more about wanting to get away from the British, than being angry about the taxes.

## Step 3: Use Evidence to Formulate Conclusions

### Formulate Compelling Arguments with Evidence

British gave the land, and the colonists owe the land to the British

Colonies were taxing themselves anyways

Tax difference between the average British citizen versus the colonial

### Switch Sides

|  | Arguments and Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | British citizens in Great Britain were paying on a per capita bases 10 times as much as the average ‘American’ in the 13 colonies |
| No | Taxation without representation and salutary neglect |

## Step 4: Communicate Conclusions and Take Informed Action
