# General Eisenhower’s Two Statements

1. Orders of the Day June 6, 1944
    1. In the speech he delivered to the members of the Allied Expeditionary Force, what reasons for confidence did Eisenhower express? Why is it important for a leader in a self-governing republic to express confidence in those he leads and a moral vision of the purposes of their fighting?

    2. What, if anything, surprises you about his speech?
       One notable aspect of his speech was his emphasis on the importance of the mission to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny. He described the invasion as a "great crusade" and framed it as a moral imperative, stating that the eyes of the world were upon the Allied forces and that the outcome of the war would determine the fate of humanity. This emphasis on the moral dimension of the war effort is striking, and reflects the deep conviction that many leaders and soldiers held about the need to fight against the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.

2. “In Case of Failure” Letter
   How does the “In Case of Failure” Letter help demonstrate Eisenhower’s commitment to responsibility in a self-governing republic?
   The "In Case of Failure" letter that Eisenhower wrote prior to the D-Day invasion is a powerful demonstration of his commitment to responsibility in a self-governing republic. In the letter, he takes full responsibility for the failure of the mission and resigns his position as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.
3. What similarities and differences do you note between the two letters?
    1. Similarities:
        1. Eisenhower wrote both documents during the lead-up to the D-Day invasion in World War II.
        2. Both documents reflect Eisenhower's deep sense of responsibility as a military commander, and his commitment to the success of the Allied forces in the invasion.
        3. Both documents are addressed to the men under Eisenhower's command, and emphasize the importance of their role in the success of the mission.
        4. Both documents acknowledge the risks and sacrifices that will be required in order to achieve victory, and express confidence in the ability of the Allied forces to overcome these challenges.
    2. Differences:
        1. The tone of the two documents is quite different. The "Orders of the Day" are more upbeat and motivational in nature, while the "In Case of Failure" letter is more solemn and reflects the possibility of failure.
        2. The "Orders of the Day" focus primarily on the logistics and tactics of the invasion, while the "In Case of Failure" letter deals more with the moral and ethical dimensions of leadership and responsibility.
        3. The "Orders of the Day" are directed at the soldiers under Eisenhower's command, while the "In Case of Failure" letter is directed more at the leaders of the Allied forces, and acknowledges the potential political consequences of failure.
