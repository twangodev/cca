## Response

Once upon a time a comely and dissolute student was subjugated to expulsion from his university. He was so tantalizingly close to graduating. His plans in learning agriculture were adjourned. However, he decided to immigrate to the United States. He went to America's best agricultural university, where he fortified his knowledge about farming. He learned about fodder, plants, and all other sorts of farm-related things. However, he was sort of struggling in classes. His alien handwriting was so illegible, his professor took 3 times longer to read his essays compared to other students. His family also detested the fact that he was learning about agriculture, they jeered at him for learning a "useless" major. However, he was unflinching, so he decided to keep studying. He eventually graduated, and had his own erratic but lucrative idea for a farm. He worked hard, sometimes he would sully his whole shirt while working on the farm. His farm was not mediocre, it was a success! His farm idea got so popular that it proliferated around the whole country. He wasn't pleased when he heard that every farmer was copying him. However, this was all a feint, he had an even better idea. Because of this, he was compensated with much wealth from this newer idea, and this time he didn't share his idea. Hopefully this story was a terse one.
