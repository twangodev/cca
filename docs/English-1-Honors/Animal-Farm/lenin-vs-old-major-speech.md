# Lenin vs. Old Major Speech

In Lenin's speech and Old Major's speech, it's audience is supposed to be the worker group. In Old Major's speech, he is talking to his fellow animal comrades; in Lenin's speech he is talking to the workers and peasants. Both Old Major and Lenin address one problem: how their lives are just meant for working. Towards the beginning of Old Major's speech, he says " We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty". In Lenin's speech he says "'If it were not for us,' they say, 'there would be nobody to maintain order, to give out work, and to compel people to work.'" Lenins implies that in their current state, they are meant to be workers. The two speeches are meant to encourage people to overthrow the current state of leadership, to change it. However, the two speeches are different. Old Major's speech is more straight to the point, he wants them to overthrow the current government. Lenin's speech on the other hand is more of a revolution. He doesn't want to completely wipe them out, he just wants to "prove that they can properly distribute labor".
