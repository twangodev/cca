### Personal Collect

God,

Creator of order in the midst of chaos, you guide people through uncertain paths.

I'm facing an incredibly competitive field in Computer Science and an overwhelming number of college applications. Provide me with clarity and direction in this stressful time. Help me make the right decisions and to find a place where I can grow both academically and personally.

Thank you for your enduring guidance.

Amen.

### On-The-Edge Prayer

God,

I'm on the edge here, burdened by expectations and looming deadlines for college applications. Stress is high and the room for error feels nonexistent.

Grant me the resilience to handle the pressure and the focus to execute each task effectively. Should things not go as planned, equip me with the perspective to understand that setbacks are not ultimate defeats.

Thank you for your constant presence and support.

Amen.
