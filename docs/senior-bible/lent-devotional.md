??? quote "Job 4:1-21 NIV"

    Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

    "If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? <br>
    But who can keep from speaking? <br>
    Think how you have instructed many, <br>
    how you have strengthened feeble hands. <br>
    Your words have supported those who stumbled; <br>
    you have strengthened faltering knees. <br>
    But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; <br>
    it strikes you, and you are dismayed. <br>
    Should not your piety be your confidence <br>
    and your blameless ways your hope? <br>

    "Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? <br>
    Where were the upright ever destroyed? <br>
    As I have observed, those who plow evil <br>
    and those who sow trouble reap it. <br>
    At the breath of God they perish; <br>
    at the blast of his anger they are no more. <br>
    The lions may roar and growl, <br>
    yet the teeth of the great lions are broken. <br>
    The lion perishes for lack of prey, <br>
    and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. <br>

    "A word was secretly brought to me, <br>
    my ears caught a whisper of it. <br>
    Amid disquieting dreams in the night, <br>
    when deep sleep falls on people, <br>
    fear and trembling seized me <br>
    and made all my bones shake. <br>
    A spirit glided past my face, <br>
    and the hair on my body stood on end. <br>
    It stopped, <br>
    but I could not tell what it was. <br>
    A form stood before my eyes, <br>
    and I heard a hushed voice: <br>
    'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? <br>
    Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker? <br>
    If God places no trust in his servants, <br>
    if he charges his angels with error, <br>
    how much more those who live in houses of clay, <br>
    whose foundations are in the dust, <br>
    who are crushed more readily than a moth! <br>
    Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; <br>
    unnoticed, they perish forever. <br>
    Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, <br>
    so that they die without wisdom?' <br>

## Interaction with Biblical Text

In Job 4:1-21, Eliphaz the Temanite addresses Job, who is grappling with immense suffering. Eliphaz speaks of the frailty and imperfection of humanity compared to God's supreme power and righteousness. He suggests that human suffering is not random; rather, it is a consequence of one’s actions. Eliphaz emphasizes the inevitability of human limitations and the futility of relying solely on human wisdom and strength.

This passage reminds us that, in our Lenten journey, we are called to acknowledge our limitations and to surrender our pride. It is a time to recognize that our human understanding is not absolute and that our strength can falter. Eliphaz’s words serve as a reminder of our need for humility and dependence on God’s wisdom and guidance.

## Reflection Questions
1. How can we offer support to others in their suffering, as Job once did, without judging the reasons for their pain?
2. In what ways can we find strength and hope in God during times of undeserved suffering?
