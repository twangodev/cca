# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt. 1: 5, 6

## Prompt

Read #7 & 8 (32-25) and answer the following questions.

1. When you think of the terms ‘mercy’ and ‘forgiveness’ what images or ideas come to mind? In what ways are our understanding of them and our practice of them incongruent?
2. How does Jesus flip our understanding regarding the importance of personal image?
3. What is the relationship between forgiveness and love? How does the author of 1 John connect those ideas together?  

## Response

1. When people say "mercy" and "forgiveness," it sounds nice, but it's easier said than done. People say they forgive but sometimes still hold grudges. Additionally, society tends to be more forgiving if you're popular or rich, which in a sense lowers the value of actually being merciful or forgiving.
2. Jesus changes our perspective on personal image by prioritizing inner values over external appearances. Instead of focusing on how we're seen by others, he teaches that our true worth lies in our actions and intentions, especially in how we treat other people. This contrasts sharply with society's typical focus on status or reputation. Despite facing widespread criticism and being rejected by many, Jesus remained steadfast in his teachings, never altering his message to gain social approval.
3. The writer shows in John 1 the relationship between forgiveness and love by pointing out that God's ultimate show of love was sending Jesus to atone for human wrongdoings. This sacrificial act serves as the basis for forgiving sins. The author then argues that in light of such divine love and forgiveness, people should love and forgive each other. In essence, the act of forgiving is presented as a natural outcome of love, making the two concepts inseparable.
