# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt. 1: 3, 4

## Prompt
Read #3 & #4 (24-25; 26-27 & additional Bible passages) and answer the following questions.

1. How has your own understanding of heaven influenced how you think about the "Kingdom of God?"
2. Respond to Dallas Willard's definition of kingdom of heaven. How does that change how we think about our role within the KOH? 
3. Define lament in your own terms. How can we strike a balance of celebration between the "good news" of Jesus and grieving the world

## Response
Sure, here are my answers to your questions from the perspective of an atheist:

1. I do not believe in heaven, however, I can understand how these concepts can be meaningful to people who do believe in them. The kingdom of God can be seen as a metaphor for a world where there is peace, love, and justice. It can be a source of hope and inspiration for people who are struggling in the world.

2. Dallas Willard's definition of the kingdom of heaven is kind of interesting. I agree with him that it is not a place, but a way of life. However, there are some aspects to which I would disagree with, the core reasoning being that our perspective on religion, specifically Christianity, is different.

3. I define lament as a way of expressing grief and sorrow. It is a way of acknowledging the pain and suffering in the world, and of asking for help to make things right. I think that lament is an important part of the human experience, regardless of whether you believe in God.

    I believe that we can strike a balance between celebration and lament by being honest with ourselves. We can celebrate the good things that happen, while also acknowledging the pain and suffering. Most importantly, it's alright to say that we don't know the answer to something too.
