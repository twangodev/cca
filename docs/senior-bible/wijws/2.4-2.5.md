# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt 2: 4 & 5

## Prompt

1. Why do you think that Christians have historically split over the issues of evangelism (spreading the message about Jesus Christ – His Life, death, resurrection, and what faith in Christ means for us) and seeking (social) justice?
2. How can “love” be the train engine that leads us both justice and evangelism when love means so many different things to different people?
3. How do the metaphors of salt and light help us rethink our role in society? How do they influence the way we think about how we engage in culture?
