# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt 4: 1 & 2

## Prompt

1. Who in your life (without naming names – think traits or ideas) are the hardest for you to love? Why? How does Galatians 6.1-3 help us meet this challenge?
2. Re-read the quote from Dostoyevsky. How do you think we romanticized this version of humanity while breeding contempt for the reality of humanity?
3. Our lived experience shapes how we read and interpret Scripture. How do we allow it to play a role in our pursuit of truth without making assumptions about God’s Word that do not glorify God and hurt others?
