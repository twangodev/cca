# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt 2: 2 & 3

## Prompt

1. Why is celebrity something that so many people see as desirable? How does this form of idolatry hurt our witness in the world and our connection with God?
2. How have you been performative in expressing your faith? In what ways has your environment contributed or encouraged it? Challenged it?
3. In both Colossians and 2 Corinthians, Paul writes about the idea of a new identity that we have in Christ and uses the image of “old things passing away.” Where in your life, might you need to let the old things pass away to really embrace God’s purpose for your life? What might renewal look like for you when you step outside CCA’s walls?
