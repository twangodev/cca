# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt 4: 3-5

## Prompt

1. Describe what “God is love” means to you. Be specific.
2. How would you explain the “ethic of love” that Jesus teaches on in Matthew 5.38-48? How do we combat our natural desire to retaliate against someone when we have been wronged?
3. What correlation do you see between prayer and community? How do you love your enemies and how can we do this better?
4. Re-read 1 Peter 3.8-9 and then apply Peter’s thoughts to a real-life situation in which you were wronged. (No names – just overarching situation) How could this situation had been different if we took Peter and Jesus seriously?
