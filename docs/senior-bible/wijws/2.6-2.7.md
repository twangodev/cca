# What if Jesus Was Serious Pt 2: 6 & 7

## Prompt
1. Why do you think Christians/churches choose to not engage or read the entire Bible? Explain.
2. What is in your "functional" Bible? Why are these passages important to you?
3. What does true heart transformation look like? How is that different from external conformity?
4. If we all sin and fall short of the Glory of God (Romans 3:23), then how do we become fit for the Kingdom of God despite "doing" and "being" good?

## Response
1. Many Christians find parts of the Bible challenging due to their complex prophecies, cultural contexts, or seemingly contradictory messages. Additionally, portions of the Old Testament address ancient practices that might not feel directly applicable to modern life. Some sections contain content that can be viewed as disturbing, such as accounts of violence or war. In certain denominations, tradition emphasizes specific sections of the Bible, leading to selective reading. Lastly, reliance on sermons or Bible studies might mean that not all parts of the Scripture are covered.
2. I don't think I actually have a Bible - alot of what I take is just distributed through multiple forms, my parents, extracurriculars, activities, and academics.
3. True heart transformation signifies an inward change impacting beliefs, desires, and actions, aligning one with God's will. This profound change is typically attributed to the influence of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life. In contrast, external conformity is about displaying behaviors that align with expected norms without necessarily reflecting an inner conviction. While such conformity might stem from a genuine respect for tradition, it can also arise from societal pressures or fear of repercussions.
4. Christian doctrine posits that humans, due to their inherent sin nature, cannot solely rely on good deeds to enter the Kingdom of God. Salvation is viewed as a divine gift, achieved through faith in Jesus Christ, as articulated in Ephesians 2:8-9. While good deeds are important, they are not the sole ticket to salvation. True spiritual transformation and growth, or sanctification, is believed to be the work of the Holy Spirit, guiding believers to become more Christ-like.
