# Government Debate Graphic Organizer

Support: Democracy

## Advantages of Democracy 
- Protect the People - We let our citizens protect themselves. We give our citizens the right to vote for their leaders.
- Accountability - We hold our own officials accountable for their actions. Our leaders have terms and if they want to be re-elected for another one they must prove that they deserve to be in office. We let our people vote out officials if they do not approve of what he is doing
- Good Citizenship - We give people a sense of ownership in their community. It makes them feel they should help out more in their community and make it better. Democracy makes a STRONGER, more PROACTIVE public

## Disadvantages of Democracy 
- Inefficient - The larger the democracy becomes the weaker we become. Collecting votes becomes inefficient.
- Minorities - Minorities have no power. The majority of the vote will be counted and not the minority
- Poor Leadership - There is too much power in the people. This is a problem when people are uneducated on major issues

## Advantages of Monarchy 
- Faster decision-making
- Cost-effective
- Elections are expensive

## Disadvantages of Monarchy
- Competence of ruler not guaranteed
- Ruler could cripple the country
- May lead to tyranny
- People have no say
- No elections
- Children can become rulers (inheritance)
- Ruler does not answer to anyone, no one can take their position
- The ruler and ruling class gain wealth and the commoners remain poor

## Advantages of Oligarchy 
- Decisions can be executed quickly, coming to a consensus can be faster than a democracy
- Women can gain power which can sway some decisions that are made, which is uncommon in other forms of government
- It can relieve social pressures, as people do not need to focus as much on politics, etc.
- Encourages a conservative approach (people have a general idea of where they are headed)

## Disadvantages of Oligarchy
- Causes further divide between social classes (allows the rich become richer and the poor become poorer)
- The social class divide causes the middle class to be squeezed out
- Each citizen has very little say over what happens
- Freedom of speech is commonly taken away from citizens, people can be silenced
- The markets can be controlled by the government
- Prevents growth over time and will be an extreme lack of diversity
- It allows for puppet leaders (weak leaders in the oligarchy must sacrifice their power to remain in their position)

## Advantages of Tyranny
- They are catalyst for change
- Tyrants control everything

## Disadvantages of Tyranny 
- One person takes power by force and has full control over the country, therefore their economy, politics, information, and culture is affected by One person who has control.
- Since One person controls the entire country, they can force the people to do certain things by controlling the information, basically the tyrants can force everything on their will.
- Though, realistically people won't have much resources to support themselves and the dictator has all the power, therefore the tyrant will become desired from physical necessity.
