# 3.1: Minerals

1. A naturally occurring usually inorganic solid that has definite crystalline structure and chemical composition
1. Elements: Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances
2. Atom: The building blocks of matter
3. Compounds: When a substance is made out of two or more elements
4. Finding out if its a mineral
    1. Must be inorganic
    2. Must have crystalline structure
    3. Naturally Reoccurring
5. How it's formed:
    4. Magma and Lava
        1. The heat from lava and magma can make rocks join together
    5. Metamorphism
        2. When temperature and pressure change a rock
    6. Evaporation
        3. When a liquid evaporates, the solid comes out of the solution
6. Classification
    7. Silicate Minerals: When a mineral is composed out of silicate tetrahedrons and other elements
    8. Non silicate Minerals: Not containing a silicate tetrahedron
        1. Native Elements: Only made up of one element
        2. Halides: When fluorine or chlorine combine with calcium
        3. Sulfates: Minerals that contain sulfur and oxygen
        4. Carbonates: When minerals contain carbon and oxygen
        5. Oxides: When compounds form when there is aluminum or iron combines with oxygen
        6. Sulfides: Minerals that contain one or more elements such as lead, or iron, combined with sulfur
