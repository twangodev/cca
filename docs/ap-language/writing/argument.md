# Rogerian Argument

- Having a full understanding of an opposition position is essential to responding
- Persuasively and accommodating rather than alienating or antagonizing
- Seeks conclusion that is satisfying for all, not destroying others

# Classical Argument

Introduction: Draws the reader in; challenges them; establishes ethos

Narration: Provides factual information, background material, established why subject is a problem; level of detail depends on the audience, appeals to logos and pathos

Confirmation: Major part of the text, development or proof needed to make writer’s case; strongest appeal to logos

Refutation: Addresses the counterargument; largely appeals to logos

Conclusion: Appeals to paths, reminds audience of early ethos, final words, ideas, actions should be memorable

# Induction

Arranging an argument so that it leads from particulars to universals using specific examples to draw a conclusion

Particulars → Universals to draw conclusions

# Deduction

Reach a conclusion by starting with a general principle or universal truth (major premise) and applying it to a specific case (minor premise)

## Syllogism

A logical structure that uses the major + minor premises to reach a necessary conclusion

# Toulmin

## Claim

A conclusion whose merits we are seeking to establish

## Support and Evidence

## Assumption and Warrant

Links the claim to the evidence; like the minor premise in a syllogism

## Backing

Further assurances or data without which the assumption lacks authority

## Qualifier

Tempers the claim, makes it less absolute (usually, probably, in most cases, etc.)

## Reservation

Explains the terms and conditions necessitated by the qualifier. Will usually gift voice to objections/rebuttals

## Template

Because (SUPPORT), therefore (CLAIM), since (ASSUMPTION), on account of (QUALIFIER), unless RESERVATION
