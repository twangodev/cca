# Next Level Barbie: Evaluation

# Prompt

Evaluate the effectiveness of your own group’s performance. Did it fulfill the designated purpose? Did it communicate ideas/examples from the text in a away that creates a specific emotional effect? What would you change if you were given a second opportunity? Support your response with examples/evidence from the performance and text

I think that our group performed relatively well, we were able to convey our message that Barbie was something that shouldn’t represent societies unrealistic beauty standards. It was able to appeal to the audience in a comedic fashion - for our group, that was walking up with a sheet of paper with really big eyes, but at the end we wrapped it up by maintaining a form of seriousness.  If I were given a second opportunity, I would have improved the props and be able to run through it beforehand.
