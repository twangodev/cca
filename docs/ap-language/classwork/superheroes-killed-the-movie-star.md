# Superheroes Killed the Movie Star -  Analysis Questions

- Why do you believe Bastien chose to quote comedian Chris Rock in the opening of her essay? Do you agree with Rock’s observation that there are “only four real stars, and the rest are just popular people?” (paragraph 1)
Bastien quotes comedian Chris Rock to develop a hook for her article - it’s a rather controversial quote, after all. Chris Rock’s quote would insight some curiosity within the audience, allowing to them to be captured within the piece. I wouldn’t completely agree with Rock’s observation, but the general message still exists.
- What are some of the consequences Bastien predicts as a result of the dearth of true movie stars? How effectively does she support these claims?
Bastien predicts that without true movie stars, there will not be as much emotion that we attach to their early performances as well as their ups and downs. Bastien supports this claim by claiming the opposite - with true movie stars, the audience will bring baggage and emotions.
- What purpose do the “various marvel Chrises” (paragraph 3) serve? How effectively does Bastien use them to develop her argument?
Marvel Chrises are popular, but have no value other than playing their own established characters. She does this with logos by letting the audience imagine her point on having their characters bring them into success elsewhere.
- Bastien divides her essay into three sections: “What is a star?”, “Why Stars Matter,” and “What Has been lost.” What progression do you see in these sections? How do they relate to one another?
The initial setting of “What is a star” allows the audience to develop and understand a topic in which most people would not to specifically think about. Then, she presents her point within “Why Stars Matter”, and finally she addresses reasons and counter arguments to her point.
- How does Bastien use cause-effect relationships to appeal to logos?
Letting the audience imagine (question to conclusion), stating generally accepted facts like actual stars within Hollywood and then analyzing how their actions (such as building their own image)
- How would you describe the tone in the essay? Consider the role of humor in your response - is she sardonic, buoyant, biter, playful, something else, a combination?
I think she is slightly sardonic and bitter within her message, but also encouraging. Her use of humor is a little hard for me personally to see (I’m not to familiar with Hollywood), but I would assume her humor goes over general memes and rumors that circulate in Hollywood.
