# Felons Voting Right Counterclaim

# Fact

The grounds on which officials grant restoration of voting rights are based on clear and specific guidelines.

States prohibit people from voting in order to keep the voting system safe and secure

# Value

Denying the vote to ex-offenders retains the integrity and equality of the voting system

# Policy

Removing the prohibitions on felon voting would not be safe or fair because the felonies committed should hold weight in determining voting rights.

The process for ex-felons to restore their right to vote should be a more reinforced process compared to other voters taking into account the crimes committed.
