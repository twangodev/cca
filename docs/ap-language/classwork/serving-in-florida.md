# Serving in Florida

# El Patron

Artist Fernando Botero, whose 1968 painting *El Patron* is shown here, is known for work that defies viewer expectations of scale and perspective. Describe the tone and mood of the painting. What message does it convey, and how does it relate to that of “Serving in Florida”? What aspects of Ehrenreich’s experiences and reportage you see reflected here?

The waiter in the image is belittled with the exaggerated proportions of each person. This can be a reference to a person’s power. In this case, the waitress must serve every request that the large man make. Overall, the image has a satirical yet sad tone.

# 2011 Time Magazine Cover

Shown here is a 2011 cover of TIME magazine. How do the cover image and text relate to each other? What connection can you make between it and Ehrenreich’s argument

The magazine has the text “Can you still move up in America,” which links closely to what Ehrenreich is saying within his article. Because being a waiter is often described as a “dead-end” job, as it provides little to no room for future growth and development, the rhetorical question “can you still move up in America” brings awareness to the issue that many waiters may face

# Luxembourg Income Study Database

The graphs shown here use data from the Luxembourg Income Study Database. What do the data in each of these graphs indicate about the economic realities underpinning Ehrenreich’s article? How might she use the graphs to emphasize the overall point that she argues?

## Graph 1

The graph may highlight the fact that a significant portion of the population in the United States is struggling to meet basic needs, such as housing, food, and healthcare, due to low wages and a lack of access to economic opportunities.

## Graph 2

The graph shows how the prices of basic goods and services, such as food, rent, and healthcare, have risen significantly over time, putting additional financial strain on low-wage workers.

## Graph 3

Supports Ehrenreich's argument that low-wage workers are not seeing significant increases in pay, despite working long hours and facing difficult working conditions. The graph may demonstrate how wage growth has been uneven and insufficient to keep up with the rising costs of living.
