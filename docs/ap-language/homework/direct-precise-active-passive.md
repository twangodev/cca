# Direct, Precise, and Active vs. Passive Voice

Professional boxing is the only major American sport whose primary, and often murderous, energies are not coyly deflected by such artifacts as balls and pucks. Though highly ritualized, and as rigidly bound by rules, traditions, and taboos as any religious ceremony, it survives as the most primitive and terrifying of contests: two men, near-naked, fight each other in a brightly lit, elevated space roped in like an animal pen (though the ropes were originally to keep rowdy spectators out); two men climb into the ring from which only one, symbolically, will climb out. (Draws do occur in boxing, but are rare, and unpopular.)

## Prompt

Analyze the verbs in the opening paragraph of “The Cruelest Sport.” How would you describe the verbs Joyce Carol Oates uses? How do they mirror the subject she is writing about? Do the verbs she uses tip you off that this piece is more complex and academic than usual for sports writing? Cite specific examples to support your view.

## Response

The verbs that Oats uses are extremely descriptive and prompt vivid imagery from the audience. For example, the verbs Oats decides to use, such as “deflected,” “bound,” “survives”. By using these strong verbs, it allows Oats to build an construct her sentences with diction such as “murderous, energies”, “coyly”, and “primitive and terrifying.” By doing so, Oats sets a dramatic, action-packed, and tense tone - something one would expect from boxing. The verb choice she uses is complex and would be considered academic - there typically isn’t as much vivid imagery used in casual sports writing.
