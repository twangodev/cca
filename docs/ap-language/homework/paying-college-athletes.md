## Response

### For Text #3

#### Line of Reasoning

1. College sports have an educational value that is more than simply the profession
2. Paying athletes would erodes the association between athletes and university values
3. College sports should not be simply seen as something monetary
4. Solutions would include investing in minor league programs, have Congress promote a more just a landscape in college and professional sports, and adjusting the current age restrictions

#### Toulmin Model

Claim: NCAA athletes should not be paid

Grounds: College sports have educational value and foster connections throughout the university, from athletes to the community.

Warrant: Keeping the educational aspect of college sports ensures that individuals are able to experience the personal growth and development that colleges are able to all students

Qualifier: The argument does not address the exploitation of college athletes who generate revenue for the schools

Reservation: Argument does not address why education value outweigh exploitation. Additionally, case-to-case situations aren’t really considered

### For Text #4

#### Claims of Policy Rank

1. Implementing a salary cap and minimum salary for college athletes
2. Using the rest of the salary cap as a recruiting tool
3. Allowing college athletes to earn money through endorsements, autographs, and image rights (Olympic model)
4. Providing lifetime health insurance for college football and men's basketball players
5. Giving athletes eight years to complete their degree

#### Title IX Claims of Policy

1. Expand the salary cap and minimum salary system to include women's basketball and other high-revenue women's sports to ensure equal opportunities for both male and female athletes.
2. Establish a separate fund to support women's sports and provide motivation to female athletes, ensuring that the revenue generated by men's sports is distributed evenly across all athletic programs.

#### Smaller Schools Claims of Policy

1. Create a tiered salary cap system for different levels of collegiate sports to make it financially viable for smaller schools, ensuring that athletes at all levels have the opportunity to be fairly compensated.
2. Develop a grant or financial assistance program for smaller schools to help them fund athlete salaries and maintain competitive athletic programs, ensuring that these institutions are not left behind in the push for fair compensation for college athletes.
