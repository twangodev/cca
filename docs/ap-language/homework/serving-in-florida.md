## Prompt

Read p. 761 and examine the cartoon from the 1997 New Yorker and answer the following questions.

1. What details has the artist chosen to include?
2. To what extent does this image embody Ehrenreich's description as a food service worker?

## Response

1. Though the picture is rather simple with little to no contrast, some details the artist has chosen to include would be empty tables, aside from the one the one customer would be sitting at. Additionally, it depicts the customer handing a bill to the server.
2. Because the image is very simple and lacks contrast, Ehrenreichâ€™s description of a food service worker could depict the struggles and mundaneness of their lives. Along with the low pay, as well as demotivating environment that the cartoon shows, this could show that the workers in a similar situation may need more awareness and support.
