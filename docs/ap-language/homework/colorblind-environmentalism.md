# Colorblind Environmentalism, Non-Equal Citizens, Trump & Education - First Hand Evidence Texts

## Prompt

Read the following texts and answer the question associated with each one regarding the use of first hand evidence.

1. "Why Can't Environmentalism Be Colorblind?" - Jennifer Oladipo
   How does Oladipo use personal experience as an effective persuasive strategy?
2. "In College, These American Citizens Are Not Created Equal" - Fabiola Santiago
   What role do anecdotes play in Santiago's argument for why the U.S. should not treat children born in the U.S. to immigrants as nonresidents when receiving state services?
3. "Trump Won Because College-Educated Americans Are Out of Touch" - Charles Camosy
   How does Camosy use the results of the 2016 election to critique the media's explanation for Trump's success with American voters?

## Response

1. Oladipo uses her personal experience as the premise to her argument. Because of the fact that she has been volunteering and working at a urban nature preserve, she uses this personal experience to build ethos. She establishes herself as a person who is very informed and knowledgeable about this topic. I would also argue that she uses a personal experience as it can lead the reader to believe that she is truly passionate about this topic.
2. Fabiola Santiago uses two primary anecdotes in her text to provide historical context as well as providing in her eyes, what is considered evidence for discrimination. Her use of the Statue of Liberty, a iconic and patriotic symbol demonstrating freedom, equality, and liberty as well as what Emma Lazarus would do both present an issue with the current state of immigration within the United States. Second, she uses Ruiz’s story to show that because her parents were undocumented, she is required to pay more because of the fact. She uses this example as evidence for discrimination towards immigrants.
3. Camosy uses the results of the 2016 election to critique the media’s explanation of for Trump’s success with American voters by stating facts in the later parts of his article. For example, bringing up the fact that high education is more often described as liberal or far-left (the ratio is 5:1 compared to conservatives). Another piece of evidence that Charles uses is that “If anyone disagrees with these dogmatic positions they risk being marginalized as ignorant, bigoted, fanatical, or some other dismissive label.” This is especially true when it comes to left - this promotion and encouragement of this “cancel culture.” With these facts in mind, Charles presents a solution - to either consider using quotas to help faculties and administrations more accurately reflet the wide range of norms and values within Americans, or jut reducing the agreement to racism, bigotry, and ignorance.
