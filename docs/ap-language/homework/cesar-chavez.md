### 3 Rhetorical Strategies

- Anecdotes: Chavez shares personal experiences and stories to illustrate his points and make his argument more relatable. For example, he shares his experience of working with the California Migrant Ministry and how it made him question why the Catholic Church was not doing the same.
- Repetition: Chavez repeats certain phrases or words to emphasize his point and make them more memorable. For example, he repeats the word “powerful” as well as the phrase “we ask for”
- Appeals to authority: Chavez references the power and authority of the Church to support his argument. He acknowledges the Church's wealth and moral and spiritual force and calls on it to use its power effectively for the poor.

### Ethos, Logos, and Pathos

- Ethos: Chavez establishes his credibility by sharing his personal experience and involvement in the strike in Delano. He also references the California Migrant Ministry, which he initially distrusted because of their religious differences, but later came to respect and work alongside.
- Logos: Chavez uses logical arguments to support his claims. For example, he argues that the Church should serve the poor because it is their duty, and that the Church's wealth should be channeled towards helping the poor. He also argues that spiritual guidance is necessary for those involved in long conflicts, such as a strike.
- Pathos: Chavez uses emotional appeals to evoke a response from his audience. For example, he describes the poor living in virtual enslavement, families crumbling, and workers growing tired without spiritual guidance. He also highlights the power and wealth of the Church and how it can be used to help the poor.

### Claims of Fact, Value, and Policy

- Fact: The Catholic Charities agencies of the Catholic Church has millions of dollars earmarked for the poor, but often the money is spent on food baskets instead of effective action to eradicate the causes of poverty.
- Value: It is the duty of Mexican-American groups to appeal to the Church to use its power effectively for the poor and to stand with those in the Church who are committed to truth and justice.
- Policy: The Church should sacrifice with the people for social change, justice, and love of brother, and should be present with and serve the poor rather than just asking for donations or building bigger churches.
