# Synthesis

## What

Read and research various sources and develop an informed opinion or measured response that considers multiple perspectives and possibilities

Anytime you take two or more ideas or concepts and combine them using your own ingenuity to create something new

Critical to consult sources to gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the topic or issue in question

Be aware of bias in an author - look for a range of viewpoints in conversation with one another

## Approaching Sources

- Maintain an open mind
- Always ask questions of the text, look for flaws in logic (logical fallacies), and assess the evidence
- Must be willing to both play the “doubting game” and the “believing game”
