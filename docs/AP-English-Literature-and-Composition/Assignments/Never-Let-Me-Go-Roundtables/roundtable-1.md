## Quotes
- "I now felt awful and I was confused. But as we stood there together staring at the fog and rain I could think of no way now to repair the damage I’d done. I think I said something pathetic like: 'It’s all right I didn’t see anything much' which hung stupidly in the air. Then after a few further seconds of silence Ruth walked off into the rain"
- "I went on watching Miss Lucy through all this and I could see just for a second a ghostly expression come over her face as she watched the class in front of her. Then—I kept watching carefully—she pulled herself together smiled and said: 'It’s just as well the fences at Hailsham aren’t electrified. You get terrible accidents sometimes.' ... 'You get terrible accidents sometimes.' What accidents? Where? But no one picked her up on it and we went back to discussing our poem"​
