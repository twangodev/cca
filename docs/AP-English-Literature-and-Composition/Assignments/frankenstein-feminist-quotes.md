    "Great fatigue she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her understanding and fancy I loved to tend on her as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension."

    This quote reflects the traditional gender roles and perceptions of women during the early 19th century.

    This quote highlights the influential yet indirect role women often played in households and society. Elizabeth's role as an intermediary for requests signifies her nurturing and diplomatic nature, roles often relegated to women. The emphasis on her engagement with poetry also reflects the limited scope of acceptable intellectual pursuits for women at the time.

    Victor’s ambition to create life challenges traditional gender roles, as the act of creation and giving life has typically been associated with femininity and motherhood. His quest to usurp this role can be seen as a critique of the male-dominated scientific community's attempts to control and dominate natural processes traditionally associated with women. The pursuit of such power reflects a patriarchal desire to surpass the limits of nature, including those boundaries traditionally governed by women.
