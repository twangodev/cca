# Trifles by Susan Glaspell

1. What individualizing characteristics do you find in the five people in the play? What contrasts are drawn between the men as a group, and the women? In what sense does the title contribute to these contrasts?

    The individualizing characteristics of the five people in the play are distinct. The men, including the Sheriff, County Attorney, and Hale, are portrayed as practical, focused on facts and evidence, somewhat dismissive of women's concerns, and often oblivious to the emotional and domestic details of the home. In contrast, the women, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale, are observant, sensitive to emotional cues and domestic details, empathetic, and more intuitive. The title "Trifles" reflects these contrasts, as what the men consider "trivial" (trifles) are actually significant clues and symbols of Mrs. Wright's life and state of mind.

2. What contrasts exist between the two women? Is one of them clearly the protagonist? Identify the antagonist.

    Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, the two women in the play, contrast in their initial attitudes towards the investigation and Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Hale is more assertive, empathetic, and critical of the men's dismissiveness. Mrs. Peters starts as more reserved and aligned with the law, due to her husband's role as the Sheriff, but gradually becomes more sympathetic to Mrs. Wright. Neither is a clear protagonist, but both undergo significant development. The antagonist is less a single character and more the societal and gender norms that led to Mrs. Wright's isolation and desperation.

3. Describe the life that Mrs. Wright must have lived. What is the importance of her having been a singer?

    Mrs. Wright's life, as implied in the play, was one of isolation, unhappiness, and possibly emotional abuse. Her identity before marriage as Minnie Foster, a singer, symbolizes her lost vibrancy and youth. Her singing past contrasts with her silent, oppressed life with John Wright, underscoring the loss of her individuality and joy.

4. Was the murder in any way justified? Why do the women conceal the evidence?

    The play doesn't justify the murder, but it provides context to understand Mrs. Wright's possible motive. The women conceal the evidence (the dead canary) because they empathize with Mrs. Wright's suffering and the failure of the law to recognize or address the emotional and psychological abuse she endured. They see the dead canary as a symbol of Mrs. Wright's stifled life, and their concealment is an act of solidarity and protection for her.

5. It is a common practice for plays to be made out of novels or stories, but unusual for the play to precede the story. Compare this play with the story “A Jury of Her Peers” (page 564). Which is clearer in its presentation of action and feelings? Which has a more direct emotional impact on the audience or reader? Discuss the differences between hearing the short story read aloud by an experienced performer and seeing the play acted by experienced actors.

    "Trifles" and its story version "A Jury of Her Peers" differ in their mediums and thus in their presentation of action and feelings. The play, with its visual and live elements, may have a more immediate emotional impact, allowing audiences to witness the subtleties of characters and setting. The short story can delve deeper into characters' thoughts and backgrounds. The experience of hearing the story read aloud versus seeing the play can vary greatly depending on the skill of the performers and the personal preferences of the audience, with each medium offering unique interpretive possibilities.
