# Baldwin Sonny Blues Literary Elements Claims

## Prompt
Write 3 claims that address the significance of choices made by Baldwin regarding characterization, setting and plot structure, point of view and theme.

## Response

- By characterizing Sonny as both a jazz musician and a heroin addict, James Baldwin reveals the profound complexities of suffering and salvation, showing that personal expression and vulnerability are not only part of Sonny's identity but are also essential for his and the reader's understanding of redemption.
- Baldwin sets "Sonny's Blues" in Harlem, employing the neighborhood's rich cultural heritage and its socioeconomic struggles as a dynamic setting that shapes the plot and reflects the themes of entrapment and liberation, thereby intensifying the narrative’s emotional and thematic depth.
- Baldwin's strategic use of a first-person point of view from Sonny’s brother accentuates the theme of perception versus reality, guiding the reader through a transformative realization that challenges initial judgments and underscores the narrative’s broader implications about the redemptive capacity of empathy and artistic expression.
