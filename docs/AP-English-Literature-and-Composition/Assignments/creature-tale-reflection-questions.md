# Creature Tale Reflection Questions

## Prompt

1. Describe the education of the creation to life and its surroundings, as well as to human life through his observation of his neighbors and the village

    Think of specific examples, both in acclimation to existence (outside a laboratory) and to interaction with others

    How does the creation's absorption of knowledge backfire on him? How does it do the same for Frankenstein?

2. How does the Creation's recounting of the events with the DeLacy's with the young girl at the creek (and subsequent man), William & Justine influence how we understand and empathize with it? Do these experiences justify his actions (William & Justine) or what he desires from Frankenstein? Explain in thorough detail

## Response

1. The Creature's education is rooted in sensory and physical experiences but then becomes more or less observation based. He learns by watching the De Lacey family, acquiring language and understanding social norms. This knowledge, however, backfires as it intensifies his sense of isolation and otherness, leading to bitterness towards humanity and his creator, Frankenstein. For Victor Frankenstein, the Creature's education and subsequent actions become a painful consequence of his own unbridled pursuit of knowledge, highlighting the ethical responsibilities and moral ramifications of scientific exploration.

2. The Creatureâ€™s recounting of his interactions, such as his observation of the De Lacey family and the incident at the creek, evokes empathy by showing his initial desire for social connection and his consistent rejection by society. These experiences, especially the harsh rejection after saving the girl, reinforce his sense of alienation and shape his perception of humanity as cruel and judgmental. However, while these experiences provide context for his actions towards William and Justine, they do not justify his turn to violence and revenge. This narrative arc in "Frankenstein" underscores the complexity of the Creature's character, caught between his longing for acceptance and his deep-seated resentment.
