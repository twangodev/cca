- Describe the language choices of Larkin in "Church Going." What stands out to you and why?
- Define the tone of "Church Going" as precisely as possible.

## Response

- The title "Church Going" serves a dual purpose. It literally describes the act of someone visiting a church, as detailed by the narratorâ€™s visit in the poem. Metaphorically, it also suggests the decline or 'going' of church influence and attendance, exploring what significance remains when traditional religious practices fade.
- Philip Larkin uses a combination of everyday language and formal expressions in "Church Going," creating a tone that is both accessible and introspective. His detailed yet straightforward descriptions of the church's interior alongside casual admissions of his own disconnection from religious practice highlight a secular viewpoint. This choice of language effectively bridges the gap between mundane reality and the deeper existential queries that the poem raises, making the poem relatable yet profound.
- The tone of "Church Going" is ironic, however it evolves into a more serious contemplation as the poem progresses. Initially, the speaker approaches the church with a somewhat dismissive and irreverent attitude, which gradually shifts to a more thoughtful and appreciative understanding of the church's lasting cultural and spiritual value. This evolution in tone mirrors the speaker's transition from skepticism to a nuanced recognition of the church's place in a secular world.
