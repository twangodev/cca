## Response

### Characters

#### Novels

- Victor Frankenstein from *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley
    - I chose Victor Frankenstein because his character embodies the consequences of unchecked ambition and the ethical dilemmas surrounding scientific advancement, which are themes that I find particularly intriguing.
- Kathy H. from *Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro
    - I found *Never Let Me Go* to be an interesting exploration of identity, ethics, and the human condition, and how it could apply to topics such as cloning and organ donation. Or even more broadly, the idea of what it means to be human.


#### Short Stories

- The Inventor from *Cannibalism in the Cars* by Mark Twain
    - He builds an engine. But I found it interesting how he poked fun at rigid structures and societal norms, which resonates with me as I get annoyed with bureaucracy and red tape.
- The Narrator from *There Will Come Soft Rains* by Ray Bradbury
    - Smart home integrations and AI. I enjoy these topics and how they can be used to explore human nature and the consequences of technology.

#### Play

- Henry Higgins from *Pygmalion* by George Bernard Shaw
    - Linguistics is getting more important in the tech world, and I think it's interesting how language can shape perceptions and social status.

#### Poem

- The Speaker from *The Road Not Taken* by Robert Frost
    - There's many different ways to interpret this poem, and I think it's a good reflection on choices and consequences.
