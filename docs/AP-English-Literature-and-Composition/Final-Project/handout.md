## Portrait of an AP Lit Student

One of the most remarkable benefits of studying literature is that we constantly take the opportunity to think, evaluate, judge, and self-reflect. Sometimes literature is cathartic; sometimes we want to trade places with a character, other times we just want to escape for a little while. They become part of our lives for a few days, weeks, months, or even years. And then there are those characters who all know too well; they don't exactly look like or talk like you, but they're staring you in the face as you gaze into that reflection on the page. Literature reminds you to peer into our souls when nobody is watching.

- Select six to seven major characters we've studied from the various novels, plays, short stories, and poems we read for this academic year.
    - At least two must be from novels, two from short stories, at least one from a play, and one from a poem.

### Visual (3-4 Minutes)

- Then, create a portrait scene with yourself and those characters. You may draw, paint, or create an interesting but tasteful collage representation. These can be done digitally as well, but printed color copies must be available for me. The scene may be from a favorite work favorite part of your life or your life to become.
- Do your best to stay as close as possible to the original persona and image of the characters.
- You should include brief quotes or scenes that reflect you or your defining moment that's reflected in your portrait.
- You will then give a brief presentation of your Portrait to the class and receive questions from your classmates. Be sure to provide an in-depth examination of the characters and yourself and the resulting interpretation.

### Proposal (1-1.5 Pages)

You must submit me to me no later than Tuesday, May 7th. Your proposal should include the following

- List of characters and the novels, short stories, and poems that they come from.
- A brief-1-2 sentence explanation about why you chose that character.
- An MLA citation for that specific story.

### Written Reflection (3-4 Pages)

- **Characterization:** Detailed reflection about each character choice and the reasons why you selected them. What is it about these characters that connect with you?
- **Setting:** Detailed description of your scene. Does this scene come from a specific literary work or a scene in your own life? Provide the details, dialogue, or other significant information about the scene. Consider additional elements of setting: weather, timing, how it might contrast or illustrate emotions, etc.
- **Plot Structure & Point of View:** How does your portrait reflect the significance of narration and plot structure elements, including tension, flashbacks, stream of consciousness or additional perspectives, etc.?
- **Themes:** What are the significant themes that you see in your characters' lives and how do they relate to the themes in your own life and the scene that you create/select?
- **Literary/Narrative Techniques:** What other literary techniques/strategies would you use to tell the story of your scene? How would these add additional meaning to your scene and connect to selected characters? Be specific and explain.
- **Literature Reflection:** In a thoughtful response, minimum one page, answer the following question: Why is reading literature-novels, plays, short stories, and poems-important?
