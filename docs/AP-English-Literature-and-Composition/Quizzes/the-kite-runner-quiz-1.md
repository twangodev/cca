## Section 2
Short Answer

1. What issue does Hassan point out to Amir about his story?

    Hassan points out to Amir that the plot of his story has a flaw: the character's problem is solved too easily with a simple act that doesn’t require any real struggle or sacrifice. Specifically, he wonders why the character doesn't simply smell an onion instead of using a magical potion to induce tears.

2. To what does Amir compare fighting kites to in Kabul?

    Amir compares fighting kites in Kabul to **"the way people cut each other’s throats"**. This metaphor emphasizes the ruthlessness and competitiveness of the kite fighting, mirroring the harsh realities of life in Afghanistan.

3. What are the two biggest motivations for Amir's desire to win the kite fighting tournament?

    The two biggest motivations for Amir's desire to win the kite fighting tournament are:

    - To gain Baba's approval and admiration, as Amir feels he has always been a disappointment to his father.
    - To prove his own worth and bravery, as he struggles with feelings of inadequacy and cowardice.

4. What Hassan phrase haunts Amir? (Hint * in Chapter 1 and right before he runs to get the final kite)

    The phrase that haunts Amir is **"For you, a thousand times over"**. Hassan says this before he runs to retrieve the final kite for Amir, and it symbolizes Hassan's unwavering loyalty and love for Amir.

5. Juxtapose life in America for Baba and Amir with life for them in Afghanistan.

   Life in America for Baba and Amir contrasts sharply with their life in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, Baba was a wealthy, respected businessman, while Amir lived in his father's shadow. In America, Baba struggles with menial jobs and the loss of his social status, while Amir finds the freedom to pursue his own identity and eventually achieves success as a writer.

6. Describe Baba's view of sin and his justification for that view. How is it contrasted with Amir's sin against Hassan?

    Baba views sin as a form of theft, believing that all sins are variations of stealing (e.g., lying is stealing someone's right to the truth). He justifies this view by emphasizing the importance of integrity and honor. This view contrasts with Amir's sin against Hassan, which involves betrayal and cowardice. Amir's guilt over his inaction during Hassan's assault and his later actions towards Hassan underscore his moral failing and the deep impact of betrayal.

7. Explore the role (his actions) of Rahim Kahn in the lives of Baba and Amir.

    Rahim Khan plays a pivotal role in the lives of Baba and Amir. He acts as a confidant and moral compass for Baba, offering support and understanding. For Amir, Rahim Khan provides encouragement for his writing and later serves as a catalyst for Amir's redemption by revealing the truth about Hassan and urging Amir to return to Afghanistan to atone for his past mistakes.

8. How does Hosseini use vivid descriptions of facial features to reveal a deeper truth about their characters? (Consider conversations about eyes, smiles, scars, etc.)

    Hosseini uses vivid descriptions of facial features to reveal deeper truths about characters. For example, Assef's cold, blue eyes and sinister smile reflect his cruelty and sociopathy. Hassan's cleft lip symbolizes his social status and vulnerability, while his genuine, loyal smile contrasts with the harshness he faces. Baba's powerful presence is highlighted by his stern features, while the scars and expressions of other characters often reveal their inner struggles and past traumas.

9. How does Soraya's desire to be a teacher reveal a stark contrast between her story and Amir's?

    Soraya's desire to be a teacher reveals a stark contrast between her story and Amir's. Soraya seeks to use her past mistakes and experiences to help others, embodying redemption and self-improvement. In contrast, Amir initially hides from his past and avoids confronting his guilt. Soraya's openness about her flaws and her commitment to education highlight the themes of redemption and the importance of facing one's past to build a better future.
