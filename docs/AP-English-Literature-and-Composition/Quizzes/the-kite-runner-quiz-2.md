## Section Two

### Prompt

Consider plot orders in The Kite Runner. Explain how 3 of the following 4 characters exist in the first and second half of the book, and how their presence affects the conflict or plot in general. (12 points)

- Assef
- Hassan
- Baba
- Rahim Khan

### Response

In "The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini, the presence of the characters Assef, Hassan, and Baba in both the first and second halves of the book significantly affects the conflict and plot development. Here's an explanation of their roles and impact:

Assef is introduced as a sociopathic bully in the first half of the book. He embodies the cruelty and brutality that Amir fears. Assef's antagonistic presence escalates the central conflict when he rapes Hassan, Amir's loyal friend and servant. This traumatic event is pivotal, as it marks a turning point in Amir's relationship with Hassan and ignites Amir's deep-seated guilt and shame.

Assef reappears in the second half as a high-ranking member of the Taliban. His presence in this role underscores the political and social decay in Afghanistan. Amir's confrontation with Assef to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, serves as a climactic moment that forces Amir to face his past and seek redemption. Assef's continuous role as an antagonist highlights the enduring nature of Amir's internal and external conflicts.

Hassan is a central character in the first half, known for his loyalty, bravery, and unwavering friendship with Amir. His rape by Assef and the subsequent betrayal by Amir form the emotional and moral core of the story. Hassan's presence and his victimization are crucial in shaping Amir's character and his subsequent feelings of guilt and remorse.

Though Hassan does not appear physically in the second half, his presence is felt through his son, Sohrab, and through the revelations about his life after Amir's betrayal. The discovery that Hassan was actually Amir's half-brother deepens Amir's sense of guilt and adds a layer of urgency to his quest for redemption. Hassan's enduring influence drives Amir to return to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab and atone for his past mistakes.

Baba is a dominant figure in the first half, representing strength, integrity, and the expectations placed upon Amir. His complex relationship with Amir, marked by Amir's desire for his father's approval and Baba's disappointment in Amir's perceived weaknesses, significantly shapes Amir's actions and motivations. Baba's moral rigidity and larger-than-life persona cast a long shadow over Amir's childhood.

In the second half, Baba's presence is felt more as a memory and through the values he instilled in Amir. His battle with cancer and subsequent death in America serve as a catalyst for Amir's growth and independence. Baba's legacy influences Amir's decisions and actions, particularly in Amir's quest for redemption. The revelation of Baba's affair with Sanaubar, Hassan's mother, adds complexity to Baba's character and influences Amir's understanding of his father and himself.

Assef's actions as a bully and later as a Taliban leader create significant external conflicts that propel the plot and drive Amir's journey towards redemption. His reappearance in the second half as a symbol of ongoing brutality in Afghanistan provides a concrete antagonist for Amir to overcome.

Hassan's victimization and unwavering loyalty highlight the themes of betrayal and forgiveness. His legacy, particularly through Sohrab, compels Amir to confront his past and seek forgiveness, driving the emotional core of the story.

Baba's complex character and his expectations shape Amir's internal conflict and his pursuit of approval and redemption. Baba's moral code and hidden secrets add depth to the narrative and influence Amir's development and actions throughout the book.

## Section Three

### Prompt

Write a paragraph analyzing one of the following themes from The Kite Runner. Explain how that theme has been shown in both the first half and second half of the book. Connect it to universal issues. (10 points)

- A search for atonement or redemption
- The effects of trauma
- The effect of wealth and privilege
- Father/son relationships

### Response

In "The Kite Runner," the theme of atonement and redemption is intricately woven through both halves of the book, driving the protagonist Amir's actions and development. In the first half, Amir's betrayal of his loyal friend Hassan, when he fails to intervene during Hassan's rape and subsequently drives him away, seeds a profound guilt that haunts him into adulthood. This act of cowardice and betrayal creates a moral chasm that Amir desperately seeks to bridge. In the second half, Amir's journey back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to rescue Hassan's son, Sohrab, symbolizes his quest for redemption. By confronting Assef, who now embodies the violent regime of the Taliban, Amir physically and morally fights to redeem his past sins. This search for atonement is a universal issue, reflecting the human need to reconcile with one's past mistakes and seek forgiveness, highlighting that redemption is often found through acts of courage and self-sacrifice. Amir's journey underscores that while the path to atonement is fraught with pain and difficulty, it is also essential for personal healing and moral reconciliation.
