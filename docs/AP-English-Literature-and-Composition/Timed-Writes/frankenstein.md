## Response
**Selected Prompt:** 3

In Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein,* the creature created by Frankenstein is given the gift of life, which serves as both an advantage and a burden. This duality Shelly portrays this gift plays opens discussion into themes of creation, isolation, and responsibility.

Arguably, the creature simply being able to live in the world is a gift itself. The creature is born into the world with physical strength, height, and almost immunity. These abilities enable it to survive in harsh environments and fend for itself, shown through events when the creature is alone in the forest and when the creature is shot while helping the girl. The creature also demonstrates mental capacity similar to humans, shown through its quick ability to learn language from De Lacey's.  However, these features that the creature has come at a cost. Shelly deliberately makes the creature's appearance to be horrifying, which scares the people around it. This leads to the creature being rejected by society, including its creator. Again, this comes at another cost. Due to the creature's mental capacity, it experiences feelings of lowliness and isolation. These emotions are also heightened by the fact that the creature desires a companion. This combination of physical and mental features that the creature has makes it a complex character that is both a monster and a human, which is crucial for the plot of *Frankenstein*.

Finally, the gift of life is utilized to portray an ultimate form of responsibility. What humans do on earth with the limited time they have here, coincides with Shelly's portrayal of the theme to live life responsibly. While Victor Frankenstein himself falls victim to this through irresponsible use of his knowledge and failure to warn others, the creature is also the one to also deal with living their life responsibly. Death is a common occurrence throughout *Frankenstein*, all of which are caused by the creature. The creature is the reason for the deaths of William, Justine, and Henry, which are all caused by the creature's desire for revenge. However, if the creature considered a more responsible approach, revenge would not have necessarily been the answer. The createure does experience emotions such as mourning and regret, which shows that it is capable of being responsible. However, the creature's lack of responsibility (along with Victor Frankenstein's) is what ultimately leads to their own downfall.

In conclusion, the creature's gift of life in *Frankenstein* is a demonstrates the duality of advantages and disadvantages that gifts can have. Through the gift of life, Shelly portrays themes of creation, isolation, and responsibility, which adds a deeper and more enriching interpretation of the novel.
