# Recursion

When a function calls itself to derive a solution to a problem

## Solving a Recursive Problem

- Find your base cases
    - Think about the simplest and smallest possible inputs to your function, such that you know the answer immediately
- Take the recursive leap of faith
    - Identify the behavior of a recursive problem, and implement a solution
    - Typically involves calling your function on a smaller input
    - Trust that your implementation is correct
- Recombination: Build up the answer to the original problem using the previous result
