# Hillary Clinton Concession Speech Reflection

1. How did it feel reading through someone else’s and scoring according to the rubric?
It felt pretty good reading through someone else’s essay. They brought up rhetorical elements that in which I felt were harder to write about, but they managed to convey their idea successfully. As for scoring according to the rubric, it allowed me to understand what is expected within in piece.
2. How do you feel about your own? What do you know you did well? What do you need to improve upon for your next RA?
I have mixed feelings about my own assignment. I think I did pretty good with the RAPS, but I don’t think I did the best with defending and providing evidence, and connecting it with my argument.
