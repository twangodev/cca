# Kristoff Response

In the article, ****Do You Care More About a Dog Than a Refugee****, Kristoff argues about how society should empathize more with victims of genocides and violence, as it has become clear that people of dissociated from global issues. But is it realistic to empathize to every single person? What does empathy even mean, on a global scale? Does it mean to just send money, or use other deadly force? This utopian solution that Kristoff describes itself impossible, unrealistic, and most importantly unsustainable. When responding to a comment about his piece about greater international efforts to end Syria’s suffering and civil war, Kristoff says “I agree that we can’t solve all the world’s problems, but it doesn’t follow that we shouldn’t try to solve any.” This valid statement, can be turned inside out and presents the question: why we, Americans, should solve all global problems, especially when our country has more problems today? Listening to a aircraft safety briefly, why would they always say to place your own oxygen mask over your face before helping others? The reason is clear: in order to help, one must be in a state where they are capable to produce the assistance required. While it is important and encouraged to acknowledge the devastating effects of violence and genocide, Americans need to ensure that our country is in a state where we are capable to be able to help.
