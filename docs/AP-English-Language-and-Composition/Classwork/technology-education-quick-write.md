# Technology and Education Quick Write

The use of technology in education presents itself as a double edged sword. On the one hand, it allows for repetitive and mundane tasks to be completed much faster. Additionally, it serves as another platform for communication, one that was proven to be critical during COVID-19. Without technology, it would have almost been impossible to be given the opportunity to learn from home. However, the downsides of technology within education is the fact that it is often taken advantage of. For example, during tests online, teachers would have to be concerned with the fact that the students would be less integral and therefore cheat. Additionally, with the increased use of social media and video games, the distractions that stem from technology lessen student productivity. As a result, it is ultimately important to realize and recognize that there must be a balance with the integration of technology in modern education.
