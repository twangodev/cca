# Abdul Jabbar - Inductive & Deductive Reasoning

1. What is Abdul-Jabbar’s major claim in this piece? What appeals does he make to support it?
   Abdul-Jabbar's major claim in this piece is that college athletes should have the right to be compensated for their name, image, and likeness, and that the NCAA's current rules regarding amateurism are exploitative and unjust. To support his claim, he makes appeals to the history of exploitation of college athletes, the economic impact of college sports, and the hypocrisy of the NCAA's argument for amateurism
2. How does Abdul-Jabbar refute the counterargument? Is this the most effective counterargument he could choose to refute? Explain why or why not.
   Abdul-Jabbar refutes the counterargument that college athletes already receive compensation in the form of scholarships and that paying them would ruin the amateurism of college sports by arguing that scholarships do not cover the full cost of attendance and that the NCAA's definition of amateurism is arbitrary and unfair. He also points out that other college students are allowed to profit from their skills and that college sports are a multi-billion dollar industry. This is a fairly effective counterargument, as it directly addresses the opposing argument and provides evidence to support the author's position.
3. Why is Abdul-Jabbar’s personal experience as a college athlete significant to the claims he makes?
   Abdul-Jabbar's personal experience as a college athlete is significant to the claims he makes because he was one of the most successful college basketball players of all time and has a first-hand understanding of the exploitation that college athletes can face. His personal experience adds credibility to his argument and allows him to speak from a position of authority on the subject.
4. Use both Inductive & Deductive Reasoning to make claims about the state of college athletics.
    - Inductive Reasoning: College sports are a multi-billion dollar industry that generates significant revenue for universities, athletic departments, and the NCAA. Despite this, college athletes are not compensated for their name, image, and likeness and are subject to strict rules regarding amateurism. This has led to a history of exploitation and injustice towards college athletes, as shown by numerous lawsuits and scandals in recent years.
    - Deductive Reasoning: If college athletes were allowed to be compensated for their name, image, and likeness, it would lead to a more equitable and just system for college sports. This would allow college athletes to receive fair compensation for their skills and would help to address the exploitation and injustice that has been prevalent in college athletics for decades. Furthermore, allowing college athletes to organize and bargain collectively would provide them with more power and agency in the system, leading to a better overall experience for athletes and a more sustainable model for college sports.
