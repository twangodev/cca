(Can be bullet points or a short paragraph highlighting the LOR.)

## Response

Ellison's Argument for Tuition-Free College:

Keith Ellison's argument for tuition-free college can be outlined as follows:

1. College education is essential for economic success and upward mobility.
2. The rising cost of college education has made it inaccessible for many students, particularly those from low-income families.
3. The burden of student debt is a major obstacle to financial stability and hinders students' ability to pursue their goals after graduation.
4. The government has a responsibility to ensure that everyone has equal access to higher education, regardless of their financial circumstances.
5. Providing tuition-free college education would benefit both individuals and society as a whole by increasing social mobility, reducing income inequality, and improving the overall economy.
6. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing federal funding for higher education, expanding financial aid programs, and making public colleges and universities tuition-free.

Overall, Ellison's argument is based on the premise that access to higher education is a fundamental right that should not be restricted by financial barriers.

Sowell's Argument Against Tuition-Free College:

1. In paragraphs 1-6, what is Sowell's tone and diction?

In paragraphs 1-6, Sowell's tone is critical and disapproving of the idea of tuition-free college. He uses negative diction and phrases such as "fairy tale," "fantasy world," and "delusion" to convey his disbelief in the feasibility and desirability of such a policy. He also employs rhetorical questions to challenge the logic behind the proposal and to emphasize the potential negative consequences.

1. Use the Toulmin Model to analyze Sowell's main position. How effective and how persuasive is his argument?

Sowell's main position can be analyzed using the Toulmin Model as follows:

Claim: Tuition-free college education is not feasible or desirable.

Evidence: Sowell argues that tuition-free college would be prohibitively expensive and that the costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers. He also contends that making college free would not necessarily increase the number of students who attend college or improve the quality of education.

Warrant: Sowell assumes that tuition-free college education would have negative consequences and that the potential benefits are outweighed by the costs. He also suggests that there are better ways to improve access to higher education, such as expanding existing financial aid programs.

Backing: Sowell cites statistics and examples to support his argument, such as the high costs of existing federal student loan programs and the limited impact of free college programs in other countries.

Overall, Sowell's argument is persuasive in its use of evidence and logical reasoning to support his position. However, some may question the underlying assumptions and warrants that he makes, such as the assumption that the costs of tuition-free college would outweigh the benefits. Additionally, his negative tone and dismissive diction may turn off some readers who are sympathetic to the idea of making higher education more accessible.
