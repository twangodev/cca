# Prompt

1. How does Domini establish her credibility in her opening paragraph? 
2. What does she do to invite her audience into her argument? 
3. Identify at least two points where she might have given way to accusation or blame or where she might have dismissed the Slow Food movement as being shortsighted or elitist. 
4. How does she find common ground and promote dialogue with her audience through civil discourse?

# Response

1. Domini establishes ethos by beginning by saying that she has been an advocate of the Slow Food movement (founded 20 years ago which celebrates harvest from small-scale farms).
2. She invites her audience into her argument by questioning herself, “Why then do I find myself investing in fast-food companies?” She sets herself up by conceding to the benefits of healthy food and their effect on not only local economies but the planet as a whole.
3. Correlates fast food for changing people’s habits and causing medical issue by providing the Greece as an example: Mediterranean diet
   Problems can be solved faster by directly tackling them rather than having things such as the Slow Food movement: McDonald’s trans fat helped the health of the community.
4. When McDonald’s moved to non-trans fats for making French Fries, this is something that the community was very pleased to hear about. However, before, it was trans-fat and other unhealthy aspects that caused civil discourse
