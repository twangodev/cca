## Response

1. “She was thin, without the taut look of wiry people” (2)
   ”Her printed voile dresses and flowered hats were as right for her as denim overalls for a farmer” (2)
   ”Her skin was a rich black” (3)
   ”Thin black lips” (4)
   ”Small white teeth” (4)
2. “She spoke to Momma in that soft yet carrying voice” (5)
   ”They were alike as sisters, separated only by formal education” (6)
   ”I heard the soft-voiced Mrs. Flowers and the textured voice of my grandmother merging and melting.”
3. The author directs the focus of the audience to the particular memory in paragraph 10, “One summer afternoon, sweet-milk fresh in my memory, she stopped at the Story to buy provisions” This is where the author begins and sets the setting of the memory.
4. “’Good day. Mrs. Henderson.’ Momma responded with ‘How you, Sister Flowers?’” (5)
   The author also uses a good amount of dialogic between paragraphs 14-24
5. ”Her printed voile dresses and flowered hats were as right for her as denim overalls for a farmer” (2) appeals to sight
   ”The sweet scent of vanilla had met us as we opened the door” (37) appeals to smell
   ”I had buttoned up the collar and tied the belt, apron-like, in back. Momma told me to turn around. With one hand she pulled the strings and the belt fell free at both sides of my waist. Then her large hands were at my neck, opening the bottom loops” (21) appeals to touch
6. “I wanted to gobble up the room entire and take it to Bailey” (40) is hyperbolic
   ”Browned photographs leered or threatened from the walls and the white” (40) is a form of personification
   ”The sweet scent of vanilla had met us as we opened the door” (37) is another form of personification
