## Response

The authors' main idea is to criticize modern art and how unartistic it is.

- Dave Barry’s quirky satire reveals his humorous appeals while implying the difficulty of old-fashioned art with examples such as “Mike L. Angelo” and “It always winds up with most of the paint in its hair. So the public considers the Sistine Chapel to be a major artistic achievement”
- Dave Barry’s use of epithet to juxtapose the views of modern artists and the public ultimately criticizes modern inartistic art in examples such as “Your professional art snots” and “stupid old moron public”
