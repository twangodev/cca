# Declaration of Independence: Inductive and Deductive

## Inductive

- It is necessary for political bands to eventually be dissolved
- The truths: all men are created equal, that they have the unalienable rights such as Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness

### Generalization

When a government does not meet these unalienable rights, it becomes the right of the people to be able to disband and create a new government that will protect these rights

## Deductive

### Major Premise

The people have the right to alter, abolish, and rebel against a government

### Minor Premise

### Conclusion

The people of the United States should be able to declare their independence from the tyrannical British
