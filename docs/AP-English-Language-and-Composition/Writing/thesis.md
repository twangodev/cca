# Thesis Statements

## Closed Thesis Statements

Statement of the main idea of the argument that also previews the major points the writer intends to make.

- Limits the number of points the writer will make
- Includes or implies the word “because”
- Focuses a short essay - a timed core restraint

## Open Thesis Statements

Does not list al the points the writer is trying to cover in an essay - more effective for longer piece of writing

- Summarizing the main point behind these concepts with one open thesis statement

## Counter Argument Thesis Statement

A summary of the counterargument, usually qualified with “although” or “but”, precedes the writers opinion

### Advantages

- Immediately address counterargument: Strengthens and making the argument appear more reasonable
- Helps with smoother transition into more thorough concession and refutation of the counterargument

Can lead to a position that is a modification or qualification rather than an absolute statement of support or rejection

### Responding to Yes or No

Provide the qualification, “In some regard, case, etc.”
