List the patients you chose to receive treatment in order of preference.  Be sure that you maximized your 30 hours.
    
   | Patients you chose  | Patients you left out |
   |---------------------|-----------------------|
   | Patient A: 10 hours | Patient B: 5 hours    |
   | Patient C: 4 hours  | Patient D: 4 hours    |
   | Patient G : 6 hours | Patient F: 4 hours    |
   | Patient K: 10 hours | Patient I: 4 hours    |
    |                     | Patient J: 6 hours    |
   | Total 30            | Total ____            |

1. Who was the first patient you chose to prioritize and why were they the most important?

      Patient A, he is one of the youngest and only temporarily needs the machine. Hopefully he will be able to get a transplant soon.

2. Who was the last patient you left out and why were they the least important?

       Patient D, she is the oldest and has the least amount of time left to live.

3. The last person to be chosen to use the machine represents what kind of economic reasoning? (or what do we call it when you choose one more of something)

      Marginal Utility

4. What person was the first person you left out? What is the economic term for this person?

      Opportunity Cost

5. Whom did you rank higher, Patient H or Patient I?  What was the basis for your discrimination?

      Patient H. He has children.

6. How did age factor into your rankings?  What was the basis for your discrimination?

      I ranked the younger patients higher because they have more time left to live (hopefully).

7. Did you choose more females or males?  What was the basis for your discrimination?

      In general, I would give females priority as statistically speaking, they live longer

8. Did you choose Patient K? Explain your reasoning.

      Yes. The one extra machine would be able to save more lives. Even if he uses our resources for a long time, the long
      term benefits outweigh the short term costs.
