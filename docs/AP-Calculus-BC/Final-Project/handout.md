# Handout

Congratulations on finishing AP Calculus BC! (Almost anyways...).

The goal for this project is to take a calculus concept/topic and be able to present that concept/topic to elementary-level students.

Requirements:

- Three people in a group maximum
- The concept/topic chosen must be "unique" to your group (for example, two groups cannot both do "Area under a curve.).
- Prepare a lesson plan for how the lesson will be carried out (a lesson plan template will be provided to you).
    - Included in the lesson plan should be some manipulative's, activity, or something that is "hands-on" that can engage younger students (think "fun" science museum or something similar).
- Practice with the class
- Present the lesson (to be coordinated with the elementary teacher)
- Debrief after the lesson with the elementary teacher about what went well and what could be improved.
