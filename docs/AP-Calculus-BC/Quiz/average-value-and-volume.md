# Average Value and Volume

1. Find the average value of $y=\sec^2(x)$ on the interval $[0, \pi/4]$.
2. Find the average value of y on the given interval $[0, \frac{5}{2}]$. (Hint: Don't need to simplify answer)

    $$
    y = \begin{cases}
    \frac{x}{4} & \text{if } 0 < x \leq 2 \\
    \frac{1}{x^2 - 7x + 12} & \text{if } 2 < x < \frac{5}{2}
    \end{cases}
    $$

3. What is a value of c that is guaranteed by the mean value theorem for integrals for the function $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ on the interval $[1, 4]$?
4. Find the volume of the region bounded by $y = e^x$, $x = 0$, and $y = 3$ rotated about the x-axis.
