    1. **Draw** an "X" on the diagram above to Indicate where the "replication fork" is. **Label** the leading strand. [1 pt]

        - The replication fork is where the DNA double helix is split into two strands, allowing for the replication of each strand.
        - The leading strand is the strand that is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, and in this case, is the top strand depicted in the diagram.

    2. **Name** the specific phase in cell cycle in which DNA replication occurs. **Identify** the number of sister chromatids in a human cell after undergoing DNA replication. [1 pt]

        - DNA replication occurs during the S phase (Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle.
        - After DNA replication, a human cell will have 92 sister chromatids. This is because each of the 46 chromosomes in a human cell is replicated to form two sister chromatids, resulting in a total of 46 pairs or 92 sister chromatids.

    3. **Explain** why DNA replication is known as a "semi-conservative" process. [1 pt]

        DNA replication is known as a "semi-conservative" process because each of the two resulting DNA molecules consists of one original (parental) strand and one new (daughter) strand. This means that half of the parental molecule is conserved in each of the new DNA molecules formed after replication.

    4. **Explain** why the resulting DNA molecule is described to have an "antiparallel" arrangement. [1 pt]

        The resulting DNA molecule is described to have an "antiparallel" arrangement because the two strands of the DNA run in opposite directions relative to each other. This means one strand runs in a 5’ to 3’ direction and the other runs in a 3’ to 5’ direction. This arrangement is crucial for the enzymes that synthesize DNA, as DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3’ end of the growing strand.

2. For the following question, please write your bases or amino acids with a "-" in between the bases or amino acids. For example, A-T-A or Lys-Tyr-Met. ***Failure to include a "-" results in up to 1-pt deduction.*** [7 points total]
