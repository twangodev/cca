    2. Urea
    3. **Lymphocytes**
    4. Water

14. The human heart is known as a double pump because

    1. It beats twice to contract the right atrium and then the left atrium.
    2. The nodes send two signals causing the relaxation of the ventricles and then the atrias.
    3. Blood flows through the heart twice through a single heartbeat.
    4. The beating of the heart causes the sound known as "lub-dub".
    5. **The heart pumps blood to the pulmonary and systemic circulation simultaneously.**

15. The nervous system and circulatory system are linked in that:

    1. the sinoatrial node sends signals to the ventricles to contract
    2. the atrioventricular node sends signals to the atria to contract
    3. the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes are collectively known as the pacemaker to set the rhythm of the heartbeat
    4. **the sinoatrial node sends signals to the atria to contract**
    5. the atrioventricular node sends signals to the ventricles to relax

16. In the evolution of plants from water dwelling organisms to terrestrial (land) dwelling organisms, plants needed adaptation of: [Select 2 correct choices]

    1. roots to anchor itself to the ground.
    2. **vascular structures for upright support.**
    3. chloroplast to be able to engage in photosynthesis.
    4. **waxy cuticle layer to prevent water loss.**
    5. leaves to capture sunlight for photosynthesis.

17. [1 pt] Explain why the heart makes a lub-dub sound each time it beats (be specific):

    The "lub-dub" sound of the heart is produced by the closing of the heart valves during the cardiac cycle.

    - "Lub" (S1): This first sound occurs when the atrioventricular (AV) valves (the tricuspid and mitral valves) close at the beginning of ventricular systole. This prevents the backflow of blood from the ventricles into the atria.
    - "Dub" (S2): This second sound occurs when the semilunar valves (the aortic and pulmonary valves) close at the end of ventricular systole, marking the beginning of ventricular diastole. This prevents the backflow of blood from the arteries into the ventricles.

18. [1 pt] Name both devices that were used to measure blood pressure in class:

    - Sphygmomanometer: This is the traditional device used to measure blood pressure, consisting of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow and a mercury or aneroid manometer to measure the pressure.
    - Automated blood pressure monitor: This is an electronic device that automatically measures blood pressure using an oscillometric method, providing digital readings.
