## Response

1. **Analyze** how crossing over is related to variation

    Crossing over is a process that occurs during meiosis where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of their genetic material. This leads to genetic variation by creating new combinations of alleles on chromosomes, which can result in offspring with traits different from those of their parents.

2. **Draw:** Suppose genes `C` and `D` are linked on one chromosome and genes `c` and `d` are linked on another chromosome. Assuming that crossing over does not take place, sketch the daughter cels resulting from meiosis, showing the chromosomes and position of the genes.

    Without crossing over, the daughter cells resulting from meiosis would each receive chromosomes identical to the parent chromosome with respect to the alleles for genes C and D, and c and d. Specifically, two of the daughter cells would inherit chromosomes with `C` and `D` alleles linked together, and the other two would inherit chromosomes with `c` and `d` alleles linked together, maintaining the parental gene configuration without any new combinations of these alleles.

3. **Describe** how polyploidy is used in the field of agriculture

    Polyploidy, the condition of having more than two complete sets of chromosomes, is widely used in agriculture to create new plant varieties with desirable traits such as increased size, better yield, and greater resistance to diseases and pests. It is particularly useful in breeding programs for crops and ornamental plants, as polyploid plants often show enhanced vigor and improved characteristics compared to their diploid counterparts.
