1. Identify the genetic diagnosis AND the gender of the fetus. (1 point)
2. Looking at the specific chromosome causing the genetic diagnosis above, the medical professional identified th all 3 of the chromatids are not identical. Determine which type of nondisjunction occurred and explain your answer. (2 points)

### Part B

1. Identify ONE similarity of ONE difference between Anaphase of mitosis and Anaphase I of meiosis. Ensure the use of proper vocabulary. (1 point)
2. Name the process in Meiosis that results in gametes that are uniquely different due to each pair of chromosome aligning randomly before separating. Briefly describe the process identified. (2 points)
3. The picture above shows the chromosomes found in a species of fruit fly. Determine the following: (2 points)
    1. In Prophase, there would be 3 chromosomes in a fruit fly cell.
    2. In the beginning of Anaphase II, there would be 3 chromatids in a cell.
