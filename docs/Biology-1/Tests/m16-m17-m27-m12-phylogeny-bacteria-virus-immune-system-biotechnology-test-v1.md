2. When using a P100 micropipette, you should NOT: (Select all correct choices)

A. use a micropipette tip when obtaining a sample.
B. press to the second stop point when trying to obtain a viscous sample.
C. slowly let go of the plunger when obtaining a sample.

3. Which of the following is/are false about viruses. (Select all correct choices)

A. Have plasmids
B. Require a host to reproduceâœ“
C. Cause systemic infection
D. Are treated with antibiotics
E. Are enclosed by cell wall

4. An individual was infected by the original strain of COVID 19. The same individual was recently exposed to the Omicron variant of COVID-10. Will the same B cell be able to fight the Omicron variant where the antigen is now slightly different due to mutation?

A. Yes. B cell can fight every pathogen with which it encounters.
B. No. B cells can only produce antibodies targeting the original antigen.
C. Yes. B cell recognizes all types of viruses.
D. No. B cells causes apoptosis to only specific antigens.
E. Yes. B cells can mutate and detect new mutations.

5. Which of the following statements about the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are false? Select all that apply.

A During the annealing phase, primers would form H-bonds with any rande sequences.
B. After many cycles of PCR, the sample would have more desired genetic product than the initial genetic sample.
C. During the extension phase, polymerase in the sample would be adding nucleotides starting from the primer in the 5'->3' direction.
D. One of the strands during PCR would be the lagging strand since polymerase can only add in the 5'-> 3' direction.
E. During the denaturation phase, the high heat would unwind double stranded DNA.

A. Plasma B cells
B. Cytotoxic T cells
C. Helper T cells
D. Memory B cells
